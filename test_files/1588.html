        <p>It's been a long time since I've posted. A LONG time. Well, summer came and you only get summers for so long. This might have been one of my last.</p>
<p>I worked a little here and there, I vacationed a bit, and spent a lot of time with the pool. Before you picture me laying out by the pool, a cocktail in hand I should explain to you that I CAN'T LAYOUT. There is something completely wrong with me, but I can spend hours swimming and flipping and flopping around.  My three year old thinks I am so much fun. </p>
<p>When I launched this blog I wanted to do something different. A DIY Blog just wasn't for me, I don't finish all my projects... (That's what ETSY is for!). I'm hardly qualified to offer advice (even though I still do) and I steal all my recipes from other blogs and my mom. </p>
<p>But I like to write. I like to be honest. I like to shop. A Boutique Blog was something different. </p>
<p>I wanted to sell a few of my favorite things here and there and tell you why they are my favorite. It's taken, what, a year? But I have finally started to post a few of my favorite accessories to sell. Take a peek, hell, take your credit cards out and then take a peak. </p>
<p>While most buyers have to be careful about buying themselves things they love for their stores... not me. How am I going to tell you to buy something if I don't love it? I can't. My mantra is "One for me... one for you." </p>
<p> </p>

<p>So a couple of months ago my best friend Jessica took me to Kenny Chesney. I wore a pair of her earrings to the concert. When I looked back at the pictures we took... Except for the fact that I never look at the lens because I am looking at myself, I thought damn I look so cute, when did I stop wearing jewelry? So a lot of what you are going to see are earrings, and you will have to forgive me for the unhealthy obsession I have with tassels. I promise more variety in the future. </p>
<p>Take a look around, click SHOP and shop a few of my favorite things.</p>

        <p>Transformation Tuesday</p>
<p>Is transformation Tuesday a real thing? Not sure…. I think it’s a thing skinny girls do to post more selfies of themselves. Sometimes previously overweight people take advantage of the hashtag to show off their progress. But you never see a fat girl post a picture on Transformation Tuesday. I usually prefer #TuesdayBoozeDay, #TacoTuesday, or any sort of alliteration usually involving food, beverages, or tons of fun. When it comes to selfies, I’m all about that face not that bass. Well today I am jumping on the Transformation Tuesday bandwagon bitches and wait until you see my transformation…. from skinny to fat.</p>
<p>Take a look at this gem. Here I am… at 117 lbs? I don’t know… lets just call it skinny. What makes me sad, is I thought I was fat. (The abs are so fake though, I can't even lie... no clue why but it was bronzer!) Even without the abs my stomach was stretchmarkless and flat.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/1930013_21645005666_2177_n_large.jpg?7375104665743126432"></p>
<p>THEN came… college in a hotel room with a microwave, a boyfriend that took me to Olive Garden or Hooters every night… a baby the doctors swore was going to be 10lbs turns out she was only 7!... a horrible sleep pattern, and a love for food I refuse to shake.</p>
<p>TahDah! Here I am now… at 153 lbs. Whew. That number literally hurt my fingers, and my feelings, to write.</p>
<p>Oh did you think I was going to show you a picture? Umm maybe once I’m skinny again!</p>
<p>Creeping on my own facebook led me to the first gem, and starring at this gem, as I ate flour tortilla, I felt amazement, self-pity and all <em>those</em> sort of feelings that led me on to a brand spanking new goal!</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I eat relatively healthy, I’ve been going to the gym, but this picture sparked a fire inside… one that couldn’t be silenced by a flour tortilla. I would like to look like this, or relatively close by October.</p>
<p>So this is my announcement. All you skinny bitches keep posting your Transformation Tuesdays, its motivation. All of you recipe sharers, keep sharing. And all of my friends…. keep the damn tortillas away from me! Let a new transformation begin!!! I'm going to start with portion control, yoga, and the elliptical.</p>
<p>Look me up on MyFitnessPal (christinhughes) and follow me on this journey with Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter!</p>

        <p>Since a lot of people are freaking out about Kat Von D’s Underage Red lipstick, I thought I'd share some other makeup names they can freak out about too. Lets see who made the Naughty List for their naughty names.</p>
<p>***DISCLAIMER: <span>If you're thinking that my post about naughty makeup names is anything besides provocative, stop reading Nana and catch my next post!</span> *****</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/10405674_10152664449085667_1436396246154970745_n_large.jpg?16615482111412100418"></p>
<p>For a brief history lesson on the topic you can read about how scandalous Victoria’s Secret was for launching their new makeup line in 1998 with “sexy” names in this article I found from the Wall Street Journal. It was laughable. In 1998 Foxy, Wild Child, and Tainted Love were the “sexy” names. .....http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB905733693105057000....</p>
<p>Welcome to 2015 where things are just down right raunchy now… but as long as the shade is right I’m not judging.</p>
<ol>
<li>Underage Red… but no one has a problem with Lolita?</li>
</ol>
<p><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Kat_Von_D_large.png?16615482111412100418"></p>
<p>Umm.. If we’re going to get deep here, about lip stick shades of all things, Underage Red might be a shade that helps you seduce an older man but isn’t Lolita a book about a 40 year old man who seduces his 12 year old step daughter? Urban dictionary says Lolita can be an “adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive. She lusts after older men, and is lusted by them in return.” But yeah... Underage Red... so controversial it was newsworthy last week. I wore it yesterday and still got ID’d at the liquor store.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>One of NARS’ best selling collections is the NARS Orgasm Collection including but not limited to....</li>
</ol>
<p><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/NARS_large.png?16615482111412100418"></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">The Multiple in Undress Me &amp; G-Spot (I am more of a Copacabana girl myself)</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Their amazing blush in Deep Throat &amp; Orgasm (Personally I prefer Orgasm in the Illuminator over Deep Throat!)</div>
<ol start="3">
<li style="text-align: center;">
<img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Buxom_large.png?16615482111412100418">Buxom Lip Sticks aren’t quite as taboo as Kat Von D but their lipsticks are really just slutty with shades like Nudist, Swinger, Two Timer, and Mistress! They aren’t the only ones, there’s more slutty lipsticks out there than I could have ever imagined.</li>
</ol>
<p style="float: left;"> 4. While lipsticks can get pretty slutty, some nail polishes are just freaking disgusting! Like a previously sold nail polish by BeachBlack thoughtfully named….. Jizz, a milky white polish. Ew. And I can’t forget to mention OPI’s Pussy Galore….. a nice shade of sparkly light pink. Ew, and if that makes you want to throw up, no worries! They also have a color called “Oh no! Roll Down the Window” a barfed color green.</p>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<ol start="3"></ol>

<p>5. The Naked Palettes are only the best palettes out there but they might push the envelope for some! (Probably not if you’re friends of mine) With eye shadow shades like Virgin, Bootycall, Half Baked, Blackout, and Nooner, part of me wishes I could turn these names into little word magnets to put on my fridge so I can make sentences. Something like... I hope the perfect angel virgins aren’t wearing Underaged Red when they get half-baked and blackout drunk before they make a bootycall. I won’t even say what color nail polish they might be wearing!</p>

<p>Well this was an uncomfortable read. Bottom line: I think we should stop slut shaming our makeup and just wear it!</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Guess what happened this month? New York Fashion Week. Brings back memories. When I lived in New York I used to sometimes dress like a hobo. When it was so cold, matching didn't matter and I don't care what Carrie does on Sex and the City, no one wants to run around the city in Louboutins when its fifteen degrees... unless its Fashion week.  You can not dress like a hobo and walk near Bryant Park under any circumstances during NYFW because those bitches all look perfect.</p>
<p>This year I wasn't obsessed with the clothes the models were wearing. Okay, yeah I was but I was more obsessed with the makeup they had on! I was so inspired, I hit up my friend and we put together a collaboration. She's a new makeup artist, and after Sunday, I'm her biggest stalker.</p>
<h4>LOOK ONE:</h4>
<p>Brown Eyes. You know what they say.... there are so many songs written about brown eyed girls to make them feel better. Well I believe this completely because I have what I so elegantly describe as poop brown eyes. Well guess what all you gorgeous green eyed and blue eyed and hazel eyed girls? You can love this look too, it looks great on EVERYONE.</p>
<p>The look is... pretty simple... it is brown eye shadow.</p>
<p>runway report: Roberto Cavalli, Giorgio Armani, Givenchy... everyone is doing it. I'm not trying to peer pressure you into brown eye shadow but the truth is, I shouldn't have to. It is literally gorgeous on everyone.</p>

<h4>LOOK TWO:</h4>
<p>"Bare minimum" meet fiery lips. Don't get it twisted "Bare minimum" is not no make up, or even less makeup. One of my favorite movie quotes "The only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor, and she wore a ton." I think it is a funny quote, I don't think you need make up to be beautiful, because that comes from the inside but you do need make up for "bare minimum" and fiery lips.</p>
<p>The look is... Forget your bronzer, forget the eyeliner, rub some gloss on your cheeks for a dewy look and pick out your favorite fiery shade of lip stick. </p>
<p>Runway report: Zac Posen and Missoni got the fiery lips but a ton of designers nailed just bare minimum.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Kris Marie Artistry: A few tips we used Urban Decay- Sin, Virgin, and Bootycall on my eyes. Lip gloss on my cheeks and lots of MAC 'Prep + Prime' Fix+ Finishing Mist... my new obsession.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">LOOK THREE:</h4>
<p>I can't do a Spring 2015 trend post without mentioning the color of the year. I have to be honest though, last year I was obsessed with Orchid, and the 2013 color of the year was one of my favorite colors, Emerald. This year I was disappointed... umm Marsala? really? It was all over the fall runway trends but what are you supposed to do with it in spring? So happy Kristine talked me into it. Get your mind off the runway and into the streets... (of suburbia?) and wear it with your seventies-boho-chic-music-festival-coachellaish-gypsy look, I don't care what you wear it with because I am going to rock it all the time.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kris Marie Artistry: Kristine started with brown shadow and added a bright red to it to get to Marsala. I was literally sad to take this look off I loved it so much.</p>

        </h1>
        <p>Don't worry I'm not cheating on Cody. I'm far too busy picking his stuff up and being totally in love with the guy to cheat on him. Still, I have a <em>few</em> side Valentines this year. Here! Take my Valentine questionnaire to see if you have more than one Valentine....</p>
<p>Who... Listens to you the most when you need to talk? Can you call for any favor and they don't hesitate to help? Gives you the best advice? Has a glass of wine for you on a Sunday because you constantly forget you live in Oklahoma and you can't buy it at the grocery store?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to 3 out of 4 to these questions then you have a side Valentine. And if you said your man does 3/4 of those, I call BS! This year my "side Valentines" are my mom and Kasey. (You can read more about them in the "Meet the Cast" section on the about me page, if you want to.)  So what the hell are you supposed to get your Valentine that your <em>not</em> sleeping with, cohabitating with, dating, married to, or just flirting with? Lingerie for your mom and breakfast in bed for your girl friend can get a little awkward.  Here are some better ideas!</p>
<p>(**SPOILER ALERT if your name was mentioned after words "side Valentine" you might figure out that I bought you one of the following items.) </p>
<h4><strong>1. Send them flowers. (I know I'm the most original blogger on the web!)</strong></h4>
<p>I told Cody a long time ago flowers are a waste of money. I have no idea why. He took it as "I don't want you to ever buy me flowers". How dare him, right?! I don't know. Well since then, I've had to bluntly state that I WANT FLOWERS, occasionally. It's not the flowers I want, I just want him to do something nice for me out of the blue. And a few times he has, but just a few. So get your side chick some pretty flowers. Save the day if she doesn't get any and if she gets some from her man, everyone else will just be really jealous... plus it might spark some interesting office rumors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/VALENT_2_large.JPG?9506417743582782132"></p>
<h4><strong>2. Send them... COOKIES.</strong></h4>
<p>Google it. You can send your side chick warm freaking, delicious, gooey chocolate cookies. Not a cookie bouquet with those crumbly cookies and the good icing. I am talking about warm freshly baked heaven. Unless you live in Oklahoma City. If you're in Texas check out a Tiff's Treats near you. If you're not, google warm cookie delivery!! This is perfect for that friend that's getting really skinny for summer, she's probably getting skinnier than you, send her some cookies!</p>
<h4><strong>3. Jamberry!</strong></h4>
<p>I bought these to help a friend at her online party and it turns out I like them a lot. This is like my go to "perfect little prize" for those who already use them and for those who have never tried! You can buy 3 get 1 Free, so while you're at it get some for yourself.</p>
<p> <img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/jamberry-2_large.jpg?17795159955370782377"></p>
<p>Don't go pissing off your "Jamberry girl" if you have one... but if you don't, you can get them here because I have an awesome one... http://www.hollielee.jamberrynails.net/</p>
<h4><strong>4. Get them something <em>they want</em>. </strong></h4>
<p>Get them a shirt or a dress that you know they'll love. Don't know what <em>they want</em>? Look on their Pinterest! I saw this little tip on an article for husbands and thought 'Holy Crap! Genius'. Then, in my most excited voice, I told Cody this GENUIS idea. He should set up a Pinterest and that would end our ongoing gift giving debacle where I buy my own gifts because I'm a  little... specific. He never did. But chances are you already have a Pinterest and you already follow your side Valentine so get them what <em>they want</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> <img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Polyvore_large.png?16874566394800636551"></p>
<h4><strong>5. Take a trip to the liquor store. </strong></h4>
<p>If you don't already get your side chick a bottle of wine here and there, or vodka (if they're one of those friends), you should start. It's just a little something that says a variety of things. Make it a set with come cute new glasses. It's all in the presentation... It can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Open up, I've had a long day" As you pull out your own bottle from your bag.</li>
<li>"I was going to buy you something different but lets face it you need a drink."</li>
<li>"I was going to buy you something different but I know you well enough to know you would rather have this."</li>
<li>"You're my favorite person, so I bought you my favorite thing."</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h4>6. This "Love It Bundle" from Younique</h4>
<p>I guess I am going to come out of the Younique closet and let you guys know that I sell this stuff. Don't worry, I won't swear by every single product in hopes that you will buy something from me but I won't hesistate to share my favs either and I LOVE this months deal. I love bags, even make up bags. I love the 3D Lash Mascara. And most importantly I love giving gifts in sets.</p>
<p><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Love_It_Bundle_large.png?5732323389858461691"></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Happy Valentines Week! Don't forget about your side Valentines this year!</p>

        <h3>Lets be honest here...</h3>
<p>Every girl has those friends that make them spend a little extra time getting ready when they're going out with them. Don't lie, you know the ones. The ones that have the perfect outfit every single time so you change ten thousand times before you find an outfit that's acceptable. The ones with the perfect hair so you use two bottles of hairspray so maybe your hair will stay curled for thirty minutes instead of ten. (Just long enough for a few selfies). Then there are the ones with the perfect makeup, they're the reason you run out of makeup wipes so often because you can never quite get the left eye to look like the right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Me_cabb516a-deb5-46c3-93f4-a21a5e366e01_large.jpg?137"></p>

        </h1>
        <p>9 Things I did In 2014 that I won’t be doing in 2015:</p>
<p><strong>I wore chevron. </strong></p>
<p>It is over, it is done. Chevron is out and wearing chevron is really out. We stopped calling it zig zag in 2011. It caught on in 2013. And then, we did what we do with every trend, we completely over did it. Goodbye tank dress with hints of chevron, goodbye long sleeve dress that is just straight up chevron. Goodbye chevron palazzo pants in the brightest of colors. May you rest in peace with fake designer sunglasses, and flats.</p>
<p><strong>I worried too much about the wrong people</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time I was a people pleaser, a doormat. Then I was the opposite, I didn’t take anything from anyone. Now I’m constantly trying to work out a good balance between doormat and bitch. I noticed in 2014, I spent too much time trying to please the wrong people. People who I’ve eventually come to realize I am over trying to please even more than I am over wearing chevron.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GXoZLPSw8U8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>I cheated…. on every diet I tried.</strong></p>
<p>I know that I cheated on every diet I tried because two days ago I had chicken nuggets from McDonalds and they have never been on any diet I’ve seen. In fact, when people talk badly about McDonalds, I get defensive. I didn’t just cheat on every diet I tried, I had a full on love affair with fast food and 2015 is time for the break up. My grocery list last night: Beet Root, Carrots, Spinach, Oranges, Apples, Lemon, Ginger Root, Red Cabbage, Pineapple, the list went on. I’m not just breaking up with fast food, I have moved on.</p>
<p><strong>I yelled a lot.</strong></p>
<p>I have to yell sometimes, I have a three year old and a husband that doesn’t shut doors, cabinets, the microwave, the dryer. He literally has an aversion to shutting things. So sometimes, I yell. But in 2014 I yelled too much.</p>
<p style="float: left;"><strong><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/New_Work_Out_Gear_large.jpg?119"></strong></p>
<p><strong>I gained 15 pounds. </strong></p>
<p>It could have been the affair I had with fast food. It could be that I hate working out. I will not gain 15 pounds in 2015, in fact I will lose 20. But most importantly I will have the cutest clothes in the gym! My new North Face is from my brother and sister-in-law! The sports bra, it's matching tights, and the two on the bottom all at Victoria's Secret! And the tights on the top right were FREE with my rewards with my Fabletics.com membership! </p>
<p><strong>I was addicted to coke…again</strong></p>
<p>Don’t call my mom. I’m not doing drugs. If I was addicted to the coke you're thinking of I wouldn’t have gained 15 pounds. For the last two months I have been drinking good old fashioned Coca-Cola all the time. When I don’t have one, I want one. It all started when, for nostalgias sake, I picked C08 at the vending machine before class instead of A10 (A10 was Green Tea). I was just going to have a coke that one time. That’s what everyone says. Goodbye Coca Cola, I will drink you one last time tonight and then you can join McDonalds on my list of exes.</p>
<p><strong>I got a degree.</strong></p>
<p>I just like to throw this in all conversations I have these days. Because I’ve been in college for five years. I’ve taken quite a few semesters off, but I’ve still been in college for a looong time. I have well over something like 134 hours, and this year I got an associates. So finally, I have something to show for the last five years. But I won’t get a bachelor’s degree until 2016.</p>
<p><strong> I wore flats… </strong></p>
<p>Ugh! In case you didn’t know, ballet flats, like chevron, they’re out. Sell your Tori flats and donate those Tom’s. They were out in 2013 but heck I wore them anyways in 2014. In 2015 I will come to terms with saying goodbye ballet flats. Hello blisters, hello height, hello to my heels that I’ve totally deserted, 2015 is your year!</p>
<p><strong>I watched a lot of Netflix.</strong></p>
<p>Oh. This isn’t changing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

        </h1>
        <p>Goodbye Thanksgiving. Hello December! I love the holidays. I love shopping, and the holidays is the perfect excuse to do it. I love the lights and the decorations even though Kyle might be looking next door for those this year. I love making the perfect Christmas list, and I love getting everything on it. Did I tell you it is December 1st and I am finished with Christmas presents? </p>
<p>Mom- Check. Dad-Check. Kyle-Check. Mother-in Law and Father In-Law- Check. Nephews-Check. Check. Check. Cody.... err did I say finished? I'm not. Because there is always Cody.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about Cody. He used to host a hunting and fishing show, he loves his job, he is a sports fanatic, he is a bit of a nerd, and he likes to work out. Since I can never get one gift for this guy let me share my list to help you out for your guy!</p>
<p><strong>The Business Man</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/steamer_compact.jpg?56"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/shave_set_compact.jpg?56"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/personalized_golf_balls_compact.jpg?56"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/tie_compact.jpg?56"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Conair Ultimate Steamer - $59.99 at Macy's......He'll love to steam his work clothes with this totally portable steamer. Forget ironing. Oh and it's a major plus for you too!</li>
<li>2. Wet Shave Kit- $39.99 at Target.... I know beards are in but not for this sexy salesman. These old school kits are the best razors for a close shave. Depending on the brand they go up to $100.</li>
<li>3. Personalized Golf Balls- A Dozen for $34.99 PersonalCreations.com... They say the golf course is the real boardroom. Get these balls personalized with your mans name or his company!</li>
<li>4. Style Box or Tie of the Month Club from Thetiebar.com.... Get a style box starting at $89.99 or sign your business man up for the Tie of the Month Club for $199. Whether its cool ties, bow ties, or black ties you man will look good in anything from the Tie Bar.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Outdoorsman</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Lantern_Charger_compact.jpg?60"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/disc_golf_compact.jpg?60"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Denali_Jacket_compact.jpg?60"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Outdoor-Life-Magazine-Apr2014_compact.jpg?60"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Rechargeable Lantern- $69.99 at REI... Okay so he's an outdoorsman but that doesn't mean he doesn't love his phone too. (Why it's good for you: No reason you can't get a hold of him on the boys trip in the outdoors.)</li>
<li>2. Disc Golf Set- $44.99 at Dicks Sporting Goods... The sun is shining. It is a beautiful day. Just as you imagine a nice picnic with your guy at the park, he interrupts your daydream to let you know he's going out with his friends to play Disc Golf. As he grabs his set he can't help but remember what an awesome girl you are for buying it for him.</li>
<li>3. Denali Jacket- $179.00 at theNorthFace.com... A sporty take on the classic North Face fleece, this jacket is sure to keep him warm in many different color options.</li>
<li>4. Outdoor Life Magazine Subscription- $10 for 1 year, $15 for 2 years. A magazine subscription is a gift that keeps on giving all year and it's not expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
<p><strong>The Sports Fanatic</strong></p>
<p><strong><img width="123" height="123" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/basketball_compact.jpg?64"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/au-lghalftimewithaubie_compact.jpg?64"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/galazy_snap_back_compact.jpg?64"><img width="180" height="107" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/NS_08TAILGATEC_33063396_compact.jpg?64"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Autographed Anything- Starting $100+ at Sportsmemorabilia.com... This is my go to site for all things autographed. It started with the Kevin Durant signed basketball I got Cody a few years back and I've been a returning customer every year.</li>
<li>2. Richard Russell Art- Prints starting at $20 at allthingsgallery.biz... I fell in LOVE with Richard Russell in Alabama a few weeks ago, his allegiance to the SEC is pretty obvious but he will paint for any team.</li>
<li>3. Team Hat- $30 at Mitchellandness.com.... A guy can't have too many baseball hats, even if he does have his favorite one. Try something new, instead of brands like Adidas and Nike go for the stylish designs of Mitchell &amp; Ness.</li>
<li>4. Tickets- find deals at stubhub.com The better the seats the steeper the price but focus more on the experience than the location.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Nerd</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/1a3a_shakespeare_insult_generator_book_compact.jpg?68"><img width="179" height="116" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/model_compact.jpg?68"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/R2D2_compact.jpg?68"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/midwest_compact.jpg?68"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Funny Books- $10+ at Urban Outfitters, Amazon... Go for a funny book "seduced by Bacon" for the guy who cooks, or The Shakespeare Insult Generator Book.</li>
<li>2. Models- Hobby Lobby or Dinosaur models at prehistoric.com... Whether its a dinosaur skeleton or a model car take your guy back in time with a fun model. It will give you something fun to do on Christmas morning.</li>
<li>3. Gadgets- like this R2-D2 Car Charger for $39.99 from thinkgeek.com... Maybe he doesn't let out his nerd too much but gadgets are the perfect and subtle way to let their nerd flag fly.</li>
<li>4. Graphic Tee- Starting at $28.99 at Urban Outfitters... my husband once told me that he loves graphic tees so much because they say he's trendy yet approachable. I don't know about the trendy part but I do know he loves them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Fitness Guy</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/fitbit_compact.png?72"><img width="175" height="136" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/bestowed_compact.jpg?72"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/Nike-Free_compact.jpg?72">     <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4801/files/rock-wall-photo-small-245x367_compact.jpg?72"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Fit Bit Activity Tracker- $99 at Best Buy... Its all the rage and the perfect accessory to keep your man healthy and fit through out the day. If he doesn't already have one, this is the perfect gift.</li>
<li>2. The Klutch Club Box- $20 a month at bestowed.com... Girls get JustFab and ShoeDazzle why shouldn't guys get monthly subscriptions. Klutch Club Box comes with 7-10 of the hottest health snacks and drinks.</li>
<li>3. Shoes- $70+ at Nike Outlets.... They say girls can never have too many shoes but I know for a fact Cody has more shoes than I do. Pick up a cool pair at a Nike Outlet near you and get a good deal.</li>
<li>4. Groupon or Living Social- Average $30... Get a Groupon to do something active with your man whether it is rock climbing, a 5K, or hot yoga, branch out and do something together that fits his need for activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Hunting!</p>
