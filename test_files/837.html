<DIV CLASS="blogbody">
<p><div id="59420_kdub2"><FONT color=#ccff66>had bio SPA this morning. it was easily the best Bio SPA i've ever done. apparently many of my friends felt the same way too =) the thing that made the huge difference is: time. for this SPA we were not required to do the experiment, though the apparatus and substances were given. instead, we were given a set of results and we were supposed to draw conclusion and answer based on that. so in the end i had a LOT of time to write my answer properly. no bad, not bad... just a pity that the rest of my previous&nbsp;SPA were so horrible, i think my bio spa marks is beyond <i>help-able</i> already v.v<BR>
<BR>
uploaded the video of yoshiki in channel news asia. this one i took during the telecast of Asia Tonight at 11 pm, and apart from being shorter than the earlier one, it was also more blur T_T as much as i want to upload the clearer one, my handphone just refused to transfer it up to my computer &gt;.&lt; sorry people, this small file is the next best thing that i have. enjoy ^^<BR>

<DIV>you'll need realplayer to play that. i used to be able to play the files, but my realplayer is having some problem now&nbsp;i can't even open the file in the computer *sigh* if there's any problems, do tell me yeah?<BR>
<BR>
<DIV><FONT color=#ccff99><FONT color=#ccffcc>Ro, of course the credits are Yumiko's ^____^ without her i wouldn't be able to see the picture at all =P about ED, currently i have no idea to contribute. don't worry though, i'd brainstorm and tell you any idea that will come up, ne!</FONT><br>

went to library after Bio SPA with steph. dawn was supposed to do CIP too, but the person refused to let her do for 2 hours, saying that the minimum time is 3 hours. anyway, as boring as library shelving duty&nbsp;ha salways been,&nbsp;we were not complaining for the first 1 and a half hours. we managed to do 2 trays for the english general section and adult fiction though we were quite <i>sian</i> already when doing, it's boring, honestly&nbsp;v.v <BR>
<BR>
when we returned to the office, the person in charge shoved a tray to us, containing&nbsp;one of our biggest&nbsp;nightmare: the children section &gt;.&lt; oh gosh, i <i>hate</i> the children section!! apart from the books being thin and thus making my head dizzy with many index alphabets and numbers to be sorted accrdingly, the children section is hardly organised at all... seems like the kids, and the adults who might be accompanying them, do not bother to place the book at the right place after they browsed through it... so in the end you'll see half of the books in a certain section do not actually&nbsp;belong there. it was always a nightmare, shelving the children section...<BR>
<BR>
though, we must be grateful that it was the children fiction books that we were shelving. the children non-fiction section is even more nightmarish if compared to the fiction section *shudder* when we saw the content of the tray, we were like giving each other that horror look... in the end, i managed to survive by doing a&nbsp;not-really-shelving-properly kind of job. i still did sort them out and put them at the correct cabinet, but if there were books which did not belong there, i left them there. anyway i&nbsp;was asked to shelf, not arrange, ne? =P<BR>
<BR>
my Maple account is fixed. the current Maple is Beta Version and there were a lot of disturbance and the connection often hang in the middle of playing. nevertheless, it was still a pretty&nbsp;fun game to play ^^<BR>
<BR>
tomorrow we'll start on normal timetable. that means: 3 periods of MT and 3 periods of Physics practicals in the middle of the day, which i don't have to attend. so the results: 3 full hours of break. what am&nbsp;i gonna do? T_T i'd rather they push all these lessons at the end of the day so that the non-physics and non-MT people can go home earlier v.v<BR>

<DIV CLASS="blogtitle"><div id="59008_kdub1">easter sunday mass</div></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="blogbody">
<p><div id="59008_kdub2"><FONT color=#ccffff><I>'last time the tomb is made like a room underground where people can bend down and look inside it. sometimes, we can get comfortable when we&nbsp;were inside a tomb, too comfortable that when we went outside, the sun light seemed so bright and jarring that we have to blink. the tomb can represent many things in our lives. are we ready to step out of our tomb and accept the light? to change the way we think and choose the right path?'</I><br>
<BR>this was roughly what the pastor said on this morning's easter sunday mass. the first things that straight away struck my mind were 2 people, both of whom i declared as unforgivable in my book due to the things that they had done. but as i sat there listening, i thought, who am i to do such thing? the Lord can forgive me and my sins, and me, the sinner, can't even forgive those who sinned against me, that's ridiculous, i don't have the power to do such things. as said in the prayer Our Father, 'forgive our sins, just like we forgive those who have sinned against us'. and all these years i was blinded. today's mass was an eye opener to me. there maybe many more things that i'm still unaware of, but at least i've started to see. and that is a good thing =)<br>
<BR>
<DIV>just for a side note, i went to church with edmond. and when we were queueing near the door to go out after the mass was finished, i was just suddenly made aware, again, of how tall he is. or rather, how i haven't managed to break the 160cm barrier.&nbsp;why, my eyes are just level with his shoulder blades &gt;.&lt; mond, share some of your height with me <I>leh</I>! T_T<BR>
<BR>
ro, this small file that i have is very-and i mean <i><b>very</b></i>* blur. but of course if you want it, i shall upload it soon and send to you, yeah? ^___^ and by all means, take that picture, girl!! i'm as anxious as you are to expand the library in Endless Dream!! ^_______________^ don't ask for my permission, anything here you can take freely!! ^.^<BR>
<BR>
i bought a new handphone chain on thursday while shopping for yessichan's b'day present. wasn't actually planning to buy something for myself, but i was highly attracted to this cute Kotoko handphone chain. for information of those who don't read or watch Chobits, Kotoko is a laptop persocon.&nbsp;persocon&nbsp;means a robot who looked much like a human and usually they are about normal person height, but laptop persocon are so small they can sit on your palm. the main laptop persocon in the movie is, of course, Sumomo, but as i couldn't see Sumomo handphone chain -and i've always been admiring Kotoko more than the cute Sumomo- i bought her ^^ almost felt like as if i have a personal laptop persocon hanging on my handphone, hohoho ^^<BR>
<BR>
tomorrow is the last day of exam, Bio SPA skill c&amp;d. i've not yet browse through my practicals and reports, but as i've so far flunked all my Bio SPA *and i do mean ALL of them* i thought the next one wouldn't make a much difference in my total SPA marks *sigh*<BR>
<BR>
~meloday~ OST of Love Hina. the song is really quite cute, though i don't know the title of the song ^^<BR>

<DIV CLASS="blogtitle"><div id="91439_kdub1">good friday sermon</div></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="blogbody">
<p><div id="91439_kdub2"><FONT color=#ff6600>i went to wihu's church today for good friday sermon, the fairfield methodist church in tanjong pagar, sermon was in indonesian. edmond asked me to go to his church but at that point of time i had already promised nata, so had to decline. anyway, the rest of the post will be done in black ink because i respect the feelings of christian readers out there who may not share my opinion. if you are liberal-thinker and not afraid to hear a criticism or two about christian, i welcome you to just highlight the whole thing to read it.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=#000000>stepped into the church like at 5 pm, we were late for almost half an hour i think. went to the balcony and have a seat. started with some prayers and then sing some songs. then the sermon started. i won't give you the details of what he said but just go to the main point that made me angry. this is like what he said, roughly.<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<DIV><i></i></DIV><FONT color=#000000><i>what is love? no religion in the world can teach you the real meaning of love. muslim talks about many things but not once in the Koran do they mention love. what is the meaning of eating the bread and wine? there are 4 interpretation on this. catholic teach that the bread that they eat literally becomes the body of jesus christ after being blessed. LITERALLY his body that they are eating. LITERALLY!!&nbsp;the wine literally is his blood. this teaching had mislead many people for centuries. then martin luther said that the the body of jesus christ is together with the bread. calvin said that the bread symbolises the body of jesus christ. but actually, the real meaning is when we eat the bread, the holy spirit is upon us and we can feel the presence of God with us.</i><br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT color=#000000>then he went on and on about interpretation of love from other religions. religions that he included were: Confucianism, Lao-Zi (taoism), Greek belief. then he went on<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<i><FONT color=#000000>catholic teaching that they are eating the body of jesus when they eat the bread is like forcing jesus to die every week! nonsense!!&nbsp;this is a blasphemy (penghujatan)!! the liberals had interpreted God's words in ways that make everything a mess! nonsense!!&nbsp;we, the reformed christian, is trying to get as close as possible to the true teaching of God's words. agustinus were in a time when there was so many teachings and there were so many interpretation that he had to make comparison between many teachings and all.<br>
</FONT></i>
<BR>
<FONT color=#000000>there were more things that he said. but this is like what made me really angry. the moment he mention muslim, there was a crease between my eyebrows. i don't like preacher who likes to dis other religions. and then he went on to dis catholic and there was definitely a frown on my face, i was actually scowling and glaring at the stupid preacher and i felt blood rushing in my veins. i was definitely feeling very angry. i know i shouldn't feel angry, anger is something that God said we should not do and i know there is no point of staying and hearing the whole sermon if my heart is actually not there. but, like hermione while listening to umbridge's speech at the beginning of book 5 *if you read harry potter, you'd know what i mean*, i want to know what else did he got to say. so i stayed on and continue glaring and listening at the same time. the moment he finished and we were standing up to sing, i said to hany 'i'll wait for you all outisde' and i straight away&nbsp;walked out of the room, down the stairs, ignoring the stares that people gave me,&nbsp;out of the building, and found the nearest rubbish bin to throw away the pamhplet that was given earlier. <br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT color=#000000>the nerve of that preacher! i felt like shouting to him! do you think that catholic people are as stupid as you are to take the bread that they eat as the literal meaning of jesus body?? do you think that we do not know the meaning of God's love? you said that john was the only person who was there when jesus died beside mary so he knows how much God's love is. if so, do you think that YOU will be able to know His love?? what the hell!!!<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>once outside i walked here and there trying to cool down and tried to calm myself down. getting angry on good friday is not a good thing to do. then i sms-ed yessichan and edmond and tommo, storming &gt;.&lt; geez!!<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>for all my 6 years in Tarakanita 3, i've never heard my pastor dis and jeer at other religion. after i left, there was times when i went to church *not catholic* and out of these rare times, i distinctly remember that 3 sermons were like that sermon that i had just now. not as much as dissing so many religions, but definitely emphasis that christianism is the best religion in the world. i know that not all christians are like that narrow-minded, but it still kept me away from going to churches coz i don't want to hear rubbish like that &gt;.&lt;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT color=#ff6600>anyway, after that i tried to met tony coz he called me asking whether i want to meet him. and so i did. then later on met up again with the rest of them. the first thing that nata asked was 'daijoubu ga?' *are you okay* and marlin said 'that was a bit harsh, don't get offended yeah? me and nata missed our church too when we listen to that' i couldn't say anything coz i could still remember all the things that he said. later on my sis said 'i should have gone with you just now' and i let off some steam on her...<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT color=#ff6600>we went to eat dinner at fish and co at centrepoint. before that met nata's friend, a shing, in cineleisure. one word to describe him is: cool. he knows how to carry himself well. and i thought his smile is so sweet cue to his *gingsul* =D anyway, the pricing at fish and co is really waay beyond my budget, but i didn't want more problems of choosing another place so we just ate there. <br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<DIV><FONT color=#ff6600>ah yeah, yesterday i went to have a nice long chat with lola, sharing opinions and feelings and info about x. he was like in the same league as W*ING, the pro X but don't like X Japan. but the huge difference between W*ING and him is: W*ING hates Yoshiki while Lola adores him, just like i do ^__^ rare people, they, the pro taiji era... i don't have anything bad to say about X, but i do admits that i like X Japan more ^^<br>
</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT color=#ff6600>~meloday~ I'll Be Your Love. yesterday caught Yoshiki for the second time in Asia Tonight at 11 pm. thanks to ika who told me that there would be a telecast.&nbsp;i also told vincent about it, dunno whether he went to watch or not. </FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV></div><br><script language="javascript"><!--

<DIV CLASS="blogtitle"><div id="45876_kdub1">The Eternal Melody II</div></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="blogbody">
<p><div id="45876_kdub2"><FONT color=#ccffcc>is officially released TODAY. a brief description on my day before i plunge full fledge into the my obsession, Yoshiki.&nbsp;how can i resist not posting... anyway,&nbsp;Bio exam just now, spent too much time on 1 essay question and neglected the other... may as well, coz i didn't have much to write about that <I>other</I> question, i can't remember how caffeine stimulates the heart and i can't remember the different features of myoglobin and haemoglobin *sigh* spent loads of time talking about forests and trees and fossil fuels, hope i can pass that section...<br>
<BR>
<DIV>anyway, now i'm going straight into the matter that brought me to internet first thing when i reached home today, the release of Eternal Melody II.<br>
<BR>yep, it's today, i had it marked on my calendar, but i didn't realised that by now cdjapan should have released the cover of both the Eternal Melody II and Yoshiki Symphonic 2002 DVD. the last time i checked they haven't. <br>
<BR>so i went to Endless Dream, after rocepta talked to me in the tagboard. i thought if she made the trouble of informing me, something else MUST have come up. and true enough, she had updated the information section and i found this great link: <a href="http://columbia.jp/yoshiki/index.html" rel="nofollow"><FONT color=#ffcccc>http://columbia.jp/yoshiki/index.html</FONT></A>&nbsp;it has the official information on the release of both works and, even better, some sample video and songs! when i watched and hear them, i just went *sigh* *dreamy looks*&nbsp;well, you'll know when YOU hear the songs. <br>
<BR>
<DIV>firstly i went to watch the 5 minutes&nbsp;preview of Yoshiki Symphonic 2002 DVD.&nbsp;it's pretty&nbsp;okay, i mean i had watched it, so no surprises at seeing Yoshiki flinging his arms everywhere conducting Seize the Light in front of full orchestra. don't laugh,&nbsp;even the fact that i'm his die-hard fan cannot make me admit that he&nbsp;is even&nbsp;<I>nearly</I>&nbsp;good at conducting... he must be really new at it, he looked pretty awkward... but he admitted it himself, and i believe he'll do much better for tomorrow's Aichi Expo opening. <br>
<BR>another piece of news that i had extracted is that Aichi Expo 2005 will be opened with the song I'll Be Your Love and Yoshiki will be conducting the orchestra! who nows we might get a glimpse of the news tomorrow in Channel News Asia! XD i'm staying home all day tomorrow to watch the news! XP<br>
<BR>moving on,&nbsp;i see the the performance of I'll Be Your Love. THIS i haven't watched, or i've watched but i can't remember. it was Nicole who was singing. i'm too used to Dahlia's voice singing the japanese version, so i was quite *erh? o_O* when i saw Nicole singing the english version. she was very pretty, looked more like a model than a singer, i tell you, but her voice is beautiful! honestly... yoshiki hasn't lost the knack of spotting talented people, it seemed.. ah yeah, rocepta said he's bringing a new voclaist to VUK. now we know there are Dahlia, Nicole, Daughter and i think Sarah*can't remember her name, background singer i guess*. but there will be a new girl, called Natalee. hmm... i can't wait to hear the her voice....<br>
<BR>and,&nbsp;no nat, it's not you XP<br>
<BR>then after that it was the preview of Blind Dance. i distinctly remember that the first time i heard it i didn't like the song. it sounded too techno-ish to me. but when i watched the preview, i thought, hey that's not remotely as bad as Yoshiki's usual temper-throwing-piano-solo! i&nbsp;rocognise his solo, but they're getting more and more neat and organised and i realised that i like the song! well let's just hear how it'll sound like when VUK debut is releases, ne?<br>
<BR>finished watching the preview, i went on to listen to the sample songs. the 1st song on the Eternal Melody II is still called the [Unnamed Song] even though i remember clearly that he had marked the title down as "7th" when i watched his documentary. hmm... knowing Yoshiki, i think it will continue to be called the [Unnamed Song], maybe the sister song of Unfinished =P the song is beautiful. started with Nicole singing solo, her clear voice singing alone, "<I>I'm standing on the edge... and coming to my senses, from a reverie... never thoght i would, never thought i'd need to say goodbye, i bid you farewell... </I>"&nbsp;and the orchestra starts ".. <I>my voiceless words are swaying in the flame..</I>." and soon followed by Yoshiki's piano. his style is getting predictable, you know, voice,&nbsp;orchestra and piano, but yet each song still managed to captivate me and send me somewhere among the clouds, my soul in an unknown, peaceful, beautiful place...<br>
<BR>moving on, moving on... another song available for sampling is Without You. now listen to me you people out there who had passed around Toshi's song Kimi Wa Inaika as a renamed file 'hide's last song', even though from the lyrics we could guess to whom the song was dedicated to, i don't think it is official that it's for hide. so please stop passing it around as 'hide's last song' coz it is really Toshi's work and it is called Kimi Wa Inaika.&nbsp;<I>this</I> song, Without You, however,&nbsp;is officially announced as the song dedicated for hide. Yoshiki had announced that he will NOT release the sung version of the song if Toshi is not willing to sing it. so, the version that is included in the CD is, of course, orchestral work. even then, he had done some re-arrangement on the song, i noticed that he had string up the whole song thoroughly so that it sounded more complete than <I>that</I> that he played on the piano several years ago. way to go, Yochan! it was another beautiful piece... i need to get my thesaurus and look up for the synonim of 'beautiful' coz i've used it at least 3 times by now&nbsp;T_T<br>
<BR>and the bestest news of all- i've been waiting for 3 whole years to say this so it's gonna be in big bold letters: <B><FONT color=#ff99ff size=5>it's OFFICIAL!!!&nbsp;the release date&nbsp;of VUK debut album is FIXED!</FONT></B> and guess when is it? people who know X Japan's history, you should know the date well in your head, it was the day when Toshi announced something to the media that made Yochan angry and refused to practice with him for The Last Live until the day before the concert itself: September 22, the official date of disbandment of X Japan. and you know the significance of the date. Violet UK will be the continuation of X, no doubt about that. no songs of the same genre, of course, before yoshiki overcome his trauma over rock song, but the idea that he's producing again is more good than good... i mean i've really waited for 3 years to say <FONT size=3><B>IT's OFFICIAL</B></FONT>!! and finally i got the chance to. and i'm glad. i'm just so glad. aren't you? ^_^ <br>
<BR>i love you Yoshiki!<br>
<BR>hope he reads that ^.^<br>
<BR>i'm downloading WM Recorder. you know&nbsp;what i'm going to do with it... don't you? well it involve certain activities that are very discouraged but still prevalent&nbsp;among internet users, especially broadband or cable users, hohoho...&nbsp;and&nbsp;edmond if you're reading this: THANKS SO MUCH!!!! =D<br>
<BR>some pictures... those green thingies are Aichi Expo mascots, but i'm glad that neither is blocking Yochan from view XD<br>

In your eyes, people see life... You see yourself<br>
as just an average person! You enjoy life, love<br>
wildlife, but also enjoy time with those who<br>
know you best. You like to get outdoors and let<br>
your mind wander over all of the mysteries god<br>
gave to you. You don't really have a certain<br>
sanctuary because you're so well-rounded, but<br>
you like having fun and adventures, but can<br>
also be found sitting quietly about, reading a<br>
book. You have a pretty good life ahead of you,<br>
never trade it for anything else :) <br>

<FONT color=#99ffff>the drawing is not really up to my taste, but otherwise i kinda agree on <i>certain</i> things. some are not necessarily true, of course, eg the part of </FONT><FONT color=#cc99ff><i>love wildlife, like to get outdoors</i></FONT><FONT color=#99ffff>. i prefer wildlife viewed from a television set, and i don't fancy being outdoor too much, and i suppose i can't be called well-rounded, but i do enjoy life =)<br>
<BR>
yesterday my bro went home, and but by nightfall i was sms-ing him to tutor me online =P was pretty frantic on MSN, went online just to look for tutor for complex number. in the end edmond and sbass asked me what's the question and i told them. edmond was quite confused with the questions, maybe they taught it differently in surabaya? but sbass managed to explain things to me, even though i didn't really understand it T__T sorry bass... <BR>
<BR>
but in the end my bro ol, and i bugged him with more questions and prevented him from watching the liverpool match, hohohoho XD was pretty fun, i typed out the questions on the chat box, but i drew my diagram using Paint and i sent the file over to sbass and my bro to check. can you imagine living without science and computers? i can't...<BR>
<BR>
anyway now i'm online to wait for my bro to sign in.. this time i need help for differential equations.. and tomorrow's math. i've studied math like i never did for the past year, i just have to pass this exam well! *prays hard*<BR>
<BR>
anyway again, my bro's online, now, jyaa minna!<BR>
<BR>
~meloday~ The Lord Of The Ring: The Two Towers CD. Howard Shore IS a great composer, don't you think?<BR>

<DIV CLASS="blogtitle"><div id="89591_kdub1">short updates</div></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="blogbody">
<p><div id="89591_kdub2"><FONT color=#ccff99>okay, i had a nice day today, supposed to be studying of course but with one distraction after another i didn't of course =P<BR>
<BR>
anyway, this is supposed to be very short, coz my bro's bathing and i'm supposed to finish this before he comes out coz he's gonna teach me differential equations and complex number 2.<BR>
<BR>
start with flag day, my best flag day ever. it's for AMP: Association of Muslim Professionals. i went to collect my tin at 9.30am and we were supposed to finish by 4, thus earning 6 CIP hours, but the perspn said if we can get our tin full, we can turn in earlier. so, me and yessichan went to our 'gold mine' at the bridge in front of Suntec City. i discovered that the place is really good for flagging, and true enough i got like 99 people donating to me in 1 and a half hour! my stickers were all gone and my tin was half full by then =P really good achievement for me =)<BR>
<BR>
then 7 pm, dinner with my bro, hany, nata, lin, tony, qkho and sbass at pizza hut, celebrating my bro's getting 3 As for A's. we ended the dinner with a game of "ultimate number' to finish up the food =D<BR>
<BR>
well, my bro;s out and i have to go, urgently.<BR>
<BR>
ciao!</FONT></div><br><script language="javascript"><!--
