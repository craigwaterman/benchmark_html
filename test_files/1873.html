				<div class="entry">
					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>One day, a while back, I asked a group of friends this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>If someone gave you a million dollars, and told you that you must spend it on yourself within one year or you’d have to give it back… what would you do with it?</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p>I didn’t leave them much time to think about it lest everyone get too lyrical and logical about the idea. I was after visceral reactions. I wanted to hear dreams.</p>
<p>One by one we went around the circle of fifteen, each woman dream-spending one million dollars on themselves. What the solid majority of my friends (young and old[er}) wanted was….</p>
<p><strong>To travel.</strong></p>
<p>I was stunned. <em>Really? </em>Because, you see, I grew up traveling all over Europe with my family. When we came home from our time of living overseas I was in high school and I promised myself that I would <em>never</em> travel again. Ever.</p>
<p>I am perfectly happy staying in my cute little cottage with occasional forays to the mountains or the seaside.</p>
<p>If I had a million dollars that I just<em> had</em> to spend on me… I’d find a vintage A-frame cabin on a lake and fix it up just so, then host Comer family and friend vacations as often as possible. And sometimes I’d go alone, all that introverted side of me flourishing in the silence.</p>
<p>When I told my daughter, Bekah, (who absolutely loves to travel whenever and wherever possible) about my surprise at my friends’ dreams, she couldn’t stop laughing. “Mom, everyone wants to travel!”</p>
<p>And though she didn’t say it, I could hear her thinking just what you’re thinking now: that I am really, really weird… or odd… or something along those lines.</p>
<p><strong>Do you want to know where I am right now?</strong></p>
<p>On a plane bound for Albania.</p>
<p>I know, I know, I don’t deserve this. Or the two days we’ll explore the rich history in Thessalonica, Greece. And certainly not the weekend we’ll stay in Donnes, an Albanian resort town on the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>And I’m asking myself the same question you’re asking: <em>Why me?</em></p>
<p>In the past couple of years I have traveled to Uganda, Brussels, Haiti, Hawaii, Germany, Austria, Italy, Indonesia and Albania. Plus, on the home front, I’ve spent time in Santa Cruz, L.A., Palm Desert, San Francisco, Vancouver, Eugene, and Newport.</p>
<p>And I don’t (or at least I didn’t) like to travel!</p>
<p>Here’s what I know:</p>
<p><strong>God is a giver of dreams… and God is bigger than our dreams.</strong></p>
<p>Which is why I am drinking coffee at 30,000 feet.</p>
<p>My secret dream was born over thirty years ago when I began to ask God for wisdom I didn’t have. A fairly new follower of Jesus with our first baby in my arms, my asking was pretty desperate.</p>
<p><em>What do I do? How do I do this? Help!</em><em> </em></p>
<p>I had no idea how to raise children to follow Jesus— I hardly knew how to follow Him myself! And so I prayed and then I introduced myself to the mother of the godliest teenagers I knew and asked if she’d teach me. Laurie Keyes was everything I wanted to be: wise, godly, consistent, joyful, so full of passion for Jesus that just to be in conversation with her was like being at a retreat. And she was (and still is!) strikingly beautiful, with that kind of glow that all the fancy clothes and cosmetics in the world cannot create.</p>
<p>I listened and I learned and wrote notes and read every book I could get my hands on that had anything to do with the spiritual nurturing of children. For decades!</p>
<p>And somewhere in there I started to want to find a way to pass on all this richness to others who, like me, don’t have a clue.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The wanting led to dreaming. The dreaming led to praying. The praying led to a whole lot of work. The work led to… <em>a dream come true.</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning as I hustled about tidying up my cottage (because everyone knows that you’ve just got to leave your house absolutely perfectly clean when going on a trip! Which, surprise, surprise, Phil thinks it utter nonsense!!), something dawned on me… something profound… something it’s taking me far too many words to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>God knows the me that I am.</strong></p>
<p>I thought I wanted to stay in my cottage in the woods, to live simple and quiet.</p>
<p>And that is, indeed, a part of who I am. But there’s more, and I didn’t know it. Now I know…</p>
<p><strong><em>I was made for this</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I <em>love</em> this adventure. I love packing my bags, reading ahead about where we’re going, saving up frequent flyer miles so I can take my now-grown kids with me someday.</p>
<p>I love meeting new people, making new friends, finding soul-sisters all over the world. I relish tasting new foods (Albanian food is the best! All feta cheese and fresh peppers), I love learning how people around the world do life.</p>
<p>Most of all, I love doing this with Phil, whose love of travel and willingness to lead the way makes him the best companion imaginable. (Plus, he gets up every morning no matter where we are and finds the absolutely best coffee to be had and brings it to me so I can drink it in bed. How’s that for the real deal kind of love?)</p>
<p>Today we fly across the world to teach parents in Durres, Albania how to raise children who are passionate followers of Jesus. They are the first generation of Believers in a country that was officially atheist until just over 20 years ago. They don’t know what they’re doing any more than I did. And they want to learn, just like I did.</p>
<p>I can hardly wait to get there! Me, the woman who made that ridiculous promise to myself. Do you think God may have been chuckling?</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a dream?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Because I think— <em>no, I know</em>— that…</p>
<p><strong>God has tasks for you that combine all of who you are with all of who He is in a dream big enough to change the world.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>There’s probably risk involved and you’ll undoubtedly be way out of your comfort zone at times. You may have to try some things you don’t think you like, and you’ll certainly have to work hard and long.</p>
<p>And oh, the joy! Because…</p>
<p><strong>There is nothing, <em>absolutely nothing</em>, so fun as <em>doing the dreams</em> God has for you.</strong></p>
<p>From my heart, high in the sky,</p>
<p>Diane</p>
<p><strong>P.S. Okay, here’s your open door:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will you dare to dream right here in black and white? Write it down for all to see, this dream you barely dare. I, for one, will pray for each and every one of you. For courage, for hope, for help— for joy.</strong></p>

<p align="center">“… They were all trying to frighten us, thinking,</p>
<p align="center">“Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.”</p>
<p align="center">But I prayed,</p>
<p align="center">“<strong><em>Now strengthen my hands.”</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">Nehemiah 6v9</p>
<p><strong><em>Now</em></strong><strong>… strengthen my hands.</strong></p>
<p>God has given me work to do, of that I have no doubt. That work gets me up early every morning, eager to get to it. It is a vocation that I love, but it’s still work. And sometimes the work wears me out.</p>
<p>Yesterday was one of those worn out days.</p>
<p>And so I slept in, drug myself sluggishly to my cabin in the back where most of my work is done, dinked around, wasted time. I started things, then abandoned them at the slightest hint of resistance, leaving a trail of messes along the path of my day.</p>
<p>It happens to me sometimes. More often than it should.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s malaise had nothing to do with my work… and everything to do with me. Sure, I was tired. I didn’t feel good, hadn’t slept well, needed a bit of rest.</p>
<p>More than anything else, I just lost steam… <em>why is that?</em><em> </em></p>
<p>And so I got up this morning, asking my Father.<em> </em>I came to Him needing to hear, wanting to know so that <em>this day</em> would be different. I asked timidly, like a naughty school-girl expecting a finger in my face.</p>
<p>Instead of reprimand, I heard compassion, grace. I sensed His heart, so much nicer towards me than my own heart is.</p>
<p>I heard Him say… <em>that He knows how that thick wall of opposition sometimes slows us down… to a crawl.</em></p>
<p>While I was lambasting myself for being lazy… He was seeing the unseen.</p>
<p>He knows what I didn’t even notice— those enemies of my soul, disguised and hidden— who, behind a smokescreen of silence— threaten, defeat, frighten, and discourage me.</p>
<p>And you.</p>
<p>Nehemiah knew them as strength stealers. Paul knew them as conflict conspirators.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as in Nehemiah’s story, the strength-stealers come in the form of a letter… and e-mail… a phone call.</p>
<p>At other times, those joy-zappers come wrapped in guilt. Or comparison. The fiery darts that defeat us before we even begin.</p>
<p>Mamas know those enemies too. The ones that keep you up at night, wrapped in worry.</p>
<p>The voices that scream <em>inadequate!</em> with every mistake you make.</p>
<p>But here’s what woke up my morning: all Nehemiah did, when he realized what was really going on was this—He prayed a simple prayer, with simple words:</p>
<p><strong><em>Now, strengthen my hands.</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p>And so as this new day beckons with new lists, new worries, new challenges, I bring these simple words to the Father.</p>
<p><em>Now, strengthen my hands.</em></p>
<p>And then I come again and bring these words for you, all the wearied ones, the ones I know and love, whose work sometimes wears them out:</p>
<p><em>Now, Father, right now, will you strengthen her hands?</em></p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>
<p>P.S. May I pray for you? If you will let me know in the comments, it would be my honor to bring this simple prayer to the Father who hears.</p>
<p>P.S.S.  Read Nehemiah’s story in Nehemiah 6, and Paul’s story in Acts 9:19-29 because what He did for these men, He offers to you— and me.</p>

					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p style="text-align: center;" align="center"> “Does He not see my ways and count my every step?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Job 31v4</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“You are a God who sees me…”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Genesis 16v14</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Every moment You know where I am.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 139v3</p>
<p>This morning the woods are awakening. Squirrels have emerged from their winter hiding to scurry and scramble up the trunks of the firs and cedars that surround my cozy cottage. The black spruce right outside my window trembles gleefully, dancing in delight as I watch. Gnarled ash trees unfurl new leaves in incremental waves of life.</p>
<p>Fresh, vibrant, resurrected life.</p>
<p>And I wonder, as I tuck myself into this safe place—my cabin in the back, <em>about you</em>.</p>
<p>As I pray for you, <em>my girls</em>, and as I lean in close to the Father’s heart to listen, I hear stirrings. I wait— still, craning to hear. A watcher in the woods.</p>
<p><em>What is it, Father?</em> Creator of all this tangled beauty, <em>what are You saying?</em> To me… to the women I love… the ones I write for?</p>
<p>And one phrase won’t leave me alone. A handful of words jingling like change in my pocket.</p>
<p align="center">… your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</p>
<p align="center">Matthew 4v4,6,18</p>
<p>His words warm me through on this chilled morning, because He sees <em>you</em>….</p>
<p>In your giving to those who need you— <em>again and again and again</em>— until you feel turned inside out from the giving…</p>
<p>In your nighttime vigil, pacing the floors, praying for someone in your life who needs more than you have to give…</p>
<p>In the intensity of your fasting, forsaking what you need for that one whose needs overwhelm your soul…</p>
<p>Three times these letters in red dance like squirrels delighting in new-found freedom.</p>
<p>Your Father, who sees in secret… Your Father, who sees in secret… Your Father, who sees in secret… will reward you.</p>
<p>A promise. A pledge.</p>
<p>And I wonder who needs to know this.</p>
<p>Who are the hidden ones— giving, praying, doing without— who need to know, right now, that You see?</p>
<p>I don’t know who you are or what you’re giving.</p>
<p>I can’t see what you’re doing or what you’re doing without.</p>
<p>Yet as I sit in my cabin surrounded by swaying branches and dancing squirrels, I bring my heart for you to the Father who sees and knows— who rewards the secret things.</p>
<p>And I feel Him bring me in close to say…</p>
<p><em>He is proud of you.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>He knows it’s hard to keep going.</em></p>
<p><em>He understands loneliness</em>.</p>
<p>I pause and I pray. I make my way into the house to warm up my now cold coffee, all the while wishing I could hold you close. Feeling the weight of this burden that is yours alone. The burden no one else sees and even if they could, they wouldn’t understand— not really.</p>
<p>I hear more…</p>
<p><em>He is with you. He is for you.</em></p>
<p><em>He wants to feed you and strengthen you.</em></p>
<p><em>He, only He, is your rest.</em></p>
<p>The woods are still now. Just the barest whisper of wind sways the branches above my watching place. They’re working now, those squirrels. Doing what they need to do: gathering food, burrowing holes, feeding young.</p>
<p>My day beckons with work that won’t get done without me, as does yours. And so I leave you with the One who sees and knows and is with you always.</p>
<p>May you know that sweet <em>there-ness</em> of God in your secret place of giving,</p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>
<p>P.S. I am here to pray for you— and would love to hear how He is meeting you in that place no one sees.</p>

					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p style="text-align: center;">Now all glory to God, who is able, through His mighty power at work within us,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Glory to Him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ephesians 3v20,21</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NLT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday was an exhilarating day for me. Eleven years ago, on Easter morning, Phil and I saw the dream of starting a church come true.</p>
<p>With more fear than faith, we’d poured ourselves into the task, gaining confidence that God was really in it as He brought others—more gifted than ourselves— to join us. A retired finance guy to handle the administration, a gifted engineer to organize the set up and tear down, wise elders to lead, efficient women to manage and multi-task. So many willing to show up and do what needed doing.</p>
<p>But still we worried. Would it work? Would anyone come? What if they didn’t? What if we’d heard wrong?</p>
<p>So we worked harder than we’d ever worked before and prayed more than we’d ever prayed before. We knew <em>we</em> weren’t enough, but we were learning that God is.</p>
<p>And as the days and weeks passed, we learned deep the lessons of dependency, that…</p>
<p><strong>When we don’t have what it takes to do the task God assigns us, He brings all that He is into the story and does more than we could ever do without Him.</strong></p>
<p><em>Do you know that too?</em></p>
<p>This morning as you bathe and dress and feed that baby, wondering how in the world you will help him grow into a man after God’s heart?</p>
<p>When you wave your teenager out the door, wondering how in the world you will help her stay strong and pure and in love with Jesus?</p>
<p>When you sit at your desk and wonder how in the world you will get it all done?</p>
<p>The fact is, without Him you and I— we can do nothing of real value.</p>
<p><strong>But with Him, in Him, following near and listening close, He can do so much more than we are capable of even dreaming!</strong></p>
<p>Which is why yesterday was so exhilarating for me. To drive in and have to slowly follow people to their cars like a parking place stalker, then walk the long way into the jam-packed building, squeezing past lines of people waiting for the Gathering to dismiss so they could make the mad dash to get seats for the next one… then to raise hands in worship, bumping shoulders, hugging friends, hearing more stories of lives rescued, watching baptisms— <em>so many!</em></p>
<p>This morning I wonder at our little faith. I apologize to this One I am learning to listen to. Again. And I feel Him smile, a little mirth added to our morning together.</p>
<p><strong>He knows the task He’s put in your path is too big for you.</strong></p>
<p>And He’s not worried at all.</p>
<p>But He knows that you are, and I think He wants you to know that…</p>
<p><strong><em>He’s with you, fully present. </em></strong></p>
<p>And that…</p>
<p><strong><em>With Him… in Him… if you will listen and do what He says&#8230; learning to trust Him a little more…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>He will accomplish what concerns you</em>.</strong></p>
<p>And I think you will be amazed. Astounded, just like I am, at what He is able to do with a man or a woman who is honestly all surrendered. Not perfect. Not super-gifted.</p>
<p><strong>Just all His.</strong></p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>
<p>P.S. Do you face a daunting task today? I would love to pray for you. If you’ll leave a few lines in the comments I’ll join with you in bringing your worries to the One who answers so willingly and so well.</p>

					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>I woke up this morning haunted by my own inadequacy.</p>
<p>All the things I should have done, ought to do, want to accomplish— and haven’t.</p>
<p>Curled up in the corner of my oversized chair I stared into the still-dark woods sipping tea and swallowing poison words.</p>
<p>Words like…</p>
<p><em>I am not enough</em></p>
<p><em>not good enough,</em></p>
<p><em>not capable enough, </em></p>
<p><em>not motivated enough,</em></p>
<p><em>not organized enough. </em></p>
<p>True words… <strong>and yet not the whole story.  </strong></p>
<p>These are the echoes of the Accuser’s truth-that-is-not-the-whole-truth. The one who writes a convincing biography of me and all my less-than’s.</p>
<p>The one who wants me to believe the lies that resonate somewhere deep in the hidden, hurting depths because if I do believe he wins.</p>
<p><strong>And you hear it too. </strong></p>
<p>I know you do. You’re a subscriber, just like me, to that hellish library where all your mistakes are categorized and catalogued, footnoted and never forgotten.</p>
<p>This morning just as the sun’s emergence began to dissipate the dark, my Savior began to dissipate the lies-that-sound-so-true.</p>
<p><em>You are who I created you to be. Not like her… nor him.  I did not craft you into the kind of person who is lauded and applauded in today’s version of heroics.</em></p>
<p><em>I made you different because I like different. I like you.</em><em> </em></p>
<p>And these words I think you, too, need to hear:</p>
<p><strong>I need you…<em> </em></strong><strong><em>as you are </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>because… </strong><strong><em>without you</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>My Kingdom would be a little less…</strong><strong><em> beautiful</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>On the last days of His life, Jesus looked into the faces of His people and He saw their beauty. He saw <em>your </em>beauty. And mine.</p>
<p>And He shuddered at the enemy’s plan to forever uglify us, His created ones. The overarching plan of the one who wants me— and you— to believe that our not-enoughness disqualifies us from usefulness.</p>
<p>And this morning as I wrestled— <em>without even knowing I was</em>— with that enemy whose version of my story shrivels my soul… the Father whispered words of worth to me.</p>
<p>Why?  because…</p>
<p><strong>He sees your beauty.</strong></p>
<p>And mine.</p>
<p>Shocking, isn’t it? And yet it’s true— the truest truth.  The truth that led Him all the way to the Cross.</p>
<p><em>For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father, </em></p>
<p><em>from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,</em></p>
<p><em>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man: </em></p>
<p><em>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</em></p>
<p><em>may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, </em></p>
<p><em>and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.</em></p>
<p>Ephesians 3v14-19</p>
<p>NASB</p>
<p>Praying that you… and I… would <em>experience</em> the love of Christ in real life this week.</p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>

					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>Dear girls,</p>
<p>I’m back at my desk after <a href="http://www.hespeaksinthesilence.com/2015/03/when-sadness-sounds-like-god/">a month of mourning</a>. Not that I’m done with sadness, but I’m sensing the invitation from the Spirit to get back to my calling to write. And so I sit, this morning, at the desk my dad made in this cabin tucked under the scented boughs of an enormous redwood tree. This spot is my refuge, a safe place where I hear God clearer than any place else.</p>
<p>The glimmering candle on my desk reminds me of the beauty of the friend who gave it as a gift of love. My new daughter-in-law’s mother, Natalia, is one of those rare treasures who sparkles with joy in the midst of a story she didn’t want. I am reminded of her as I do the final edits on <a href="http://www.hespeaksinthesilence.com/2013/11/my-secret-dream/">my own story</a>. Of how the Redeemer we follow weaves texture and color and loveliness into our lives in spite of— or perhaps because of— difficulties.</p>
<p>He is the Beauty-Maker and as He draws us close, we become like Him.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful.</strong></p>
<p>This morning I thought I’d bring you into my cabin to peer over my shoulder as I smooth and polish and pray and ponder over the words that will soon be put to print.</p>
<p>This is a glimpse of the me-I-was just before I was diagnosed with a progressive hearing loss that would eventually lead to total deafness. I was 26, enveloped in the world of babies and toddlers, homeschooling a first grader who gulped up knowledge like a starving lion.</p>
<p><em>I loved my life</em>. But something left me empty and longing for more…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I wasn’t happy, not really. And I knew it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>And so I began to do the only thing I knew to do, the only thing a good Christian girl could do—I prayed. Every day, I asked God to do something, anything to change my heart. I prayed when I woke up, while jogging, while shopping, while cooking yet another family meal on yet another day of doing right.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I didn’t pray once. Or even twice. I prayed every chance I got, as if by begging God, I’d get Him to hear me and He’d have to give me what I craved.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I needed more. I wanted more. I had to have more!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God knew I would need all of Him to face the days ahead. He also knew that in order for Him to answer my cries for more, I would first need to let go of the pervasively self-serving idea of my own goodness.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The journey that lay ahead of me was going to be more arduous than all my rule abiding good-girl-ness would be able to handle. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I would face dark days, days of discovering that I was not as good as I’d thought, that my façade wouldn’t hold up under the pressures of life gone wrong, that a desperately “bad” girl lurked in my soul.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>That I was a woman who didn’t know her true colors until she didn’t get her way. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I was about to embark on a journey of facing the worst about myself and finding God in the rubble. In that place of desperation, I would discover that what God wanted more than all of my exhausting efforts to be good was <em>me</em>, just as I am.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The real me.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>And though I would flounder and fail, though I would shake my fist in His face, He couldn’t wait to gather me in close to show me what I’d been wanting all along.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I edit these words I am praying for all of you who know the hunger that haunted me then. That emptiness, the sense that <em>having everything I ever wanted was not enough.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am praying that you will hear and know and experience the love of God down deep in the marrow of your bones.</p>
<p>That you will crave Him, longing for the beauty He alone brings. And that you won’t stop seeking until you’ve found all He has for you.</p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>

					<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p><a title="A GOOD DAD" href="http://www.hespeaksinthesilence.com/2015/02/a-good-dad/">With my dad so recently residing in the presence of God</a>, I’ve been thinking a lot about heaven. Trying to figure out what it means, this “going away” or “falling asleep” or “departing”.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I want to know:</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>Can he see me?</p>
<p>Who else is there?</p>
<p>What would he say to me if he could?</p>
<p>And then this morning my time set apart for listening in God’s Word took me from Colossians 1v1-6 to I Thessalonians 5v8.</p>
<p>Paul is commending his Colossian friends for their faith in God and for their obvious love for “all God’s people everywhere”. Which, he says, “spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven”…</p>
<p><strong>The words strike me.</strong></p>
<p>Faith springs from hope?  Hope in heaven?</p>
<p>Truth is, my faith seems so shaky as I worry my way through everyday life.</p>
<p><em>Do we have enough savings? Can I write the Intentional Parents book adequately or will I fail? Do I have time for everything I think I need to do? Is Mom going to be okay? How can I help her? How in the world am I going to find a home for their dog, Barney?!</em></p>
<p>And my love for “all God’s people everywhere” is more like a<em> love for a few of God’s people right here as long as they’re nice to me.</em></p>
<p>How, I ask Him, did these people become people of great faith and generous love?</p>
<p>And how can I?</p>
<p>And how does <em>hope in heaven</em> have anything to do with my todays?</p>
<p>I stumble on the answer found tucked at the end of a sentence in I Thessalonians 5v8:</p>
<p>“… let us put on… the hope of salvation as a helmet.”</p>
<p>It dawns on me suddenly, this helmet metaphor: <strong>A helmet protects my head.</strong></p>
<p>By purposely putting on hope- <em>not just any hope, but hope in salvation, in forever, in what all of life is leading up to</em>—I actually protect my mind from wrong thinking that leads to worry.</p>
<p>Wrong thinking which creates fertile ground for  fretting and frustration when all of life isn’t neat and tidy, just the way I like it.</p>
<p>Wrong thinking that convinces me God owes me more… more money, more time, more ease.</p>
<p>Wrong thinking that makes me self-protective and prickly with people who poke at me, or who express their disapproval of the way I do life.</p>
<p><strong>I need this helmet! </strong></p>
<p>Because without one I wind up with a sort of spiritual concussion, with ringing in my ears that drowns out the sound of God in my soul.</p>
<p>And so this morning I purposely put on my helmet of hope.</p>
<p>I imagine the way life will be when a new earth replaces this one and God invites me to take part in life as He meant it to be.</p>
<p>I think beyond the deadline that weighs heavily on my day, to the coming day when my life begins again.</p>
<p>I choose to remember what I’m really about: Jesus and His kingdom, His work, His will, His way.</p>
<p>And suddenly everything changes. Hope fuses me with energy to complete the tasks assigned to this day, to do what needs doing while I look for signs of His coming— for signs of Him.</p>
<p>Those blossoms on the tulip tree out back remind me that He is unfolding this day and that <em>beauty comes not from striving but from resting in His working.</em></p>
<p>Hope rises to turn my tasks into joyous work, to infuse my day with purpose. It won’t always be this hard,<em> Someday </em>is coming.</p>
<p>And in the meantime I’d better scurry because He’s called me to things that will last forever. And I’d better look closely at my lists lest I waste time on things that don’t matter in light of that <em>Someday</em>.</p>
<p>He beckons me towards giving and serving and worshipping and listening close to His words to me. He invites me to protect my mind by keeping <em>Someday</em> in sight.</p>
<p>And my dad is there. He’s stepped into the Someday that lasts forever.</p>
<p>See you there, Dad! Someday.</p>
<p>From my heart,</p>
<p>Diane</p>
<p><strong>P.S. I’ll resume my letters to Matt and Simona about OUR HOUSE soon. For now I’m just letting you in on my mourning. Thank you for your beautiful messages of condolence to me. Your kindness soothes my soul.</strong></p>
