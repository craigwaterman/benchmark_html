          <p>The people we work with at Big Cartel are one of the best reasons to keep showing up to work every day. The staff here is full of fun art-lovers, designers, DIYers, and musicians. For this showcase, we’d like to introduce you to our customer support super sleuth, <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/team/">Rachel Gollay</a>. She’s picked out a few of her favorite Big Cartel stores to share with us here, in addition to answering a few personal questions.</p>

          <p><a href="http://store.milestogoclothing.com/">Miles To Go</a> - Rachel says: <em>“Gorgeous tees and prints for literary nerds”</em></p>
          
          <h3>BC: How long have you been with Big Cartel?</h3>
          
          <p><strong>RG:</strong> Since March of 2011 — my one year anniversary is just around the corner. (Editor’s note: Her anniversary is tomorrow, March 28! Hurray!)</p>

          <h3>BC: When you’re not helping store owners make the most of their shops you make music, right? Can you tell us about your <a href="http://www.rachelgollay.com/">song-a-week endeavor</a> for 2012? </h3>
          
          <p><strong>RG:</strong> I decided it would be a fun challenge to write, record, and upload one new original song per week this year. So far it’s been a really great experiment in testing my limits creatively. In the past I had a bad habit of writing songs, revising them to death, and never letting anybody else hear them. With this challenge, I’m pushing to put together something new and release it out into the world in that moment. And so far, the feedback from friends and listeners has been really positive and encouraging, and the end goal is to have a nice little batch of songs to keep working on and polishing up.</p>

          <h3>BC: In addition to making the songs available to stream you sell them using our sister-site <a href="http://pulleyapp.com/">Pulley</a>. How’s it been getting out from behind the scenes and using Pulley as a customer? </h3>
          
          <p><strong>RG:</strong> Pulley is incredible and crazy simple to use. In just a few clicks, my songs are out there and available for purchase. No jumping through hoops or coding, and I can post up purchase links anywhere—Facebook, my blog, e-mail, wherever—which lets me get back to doing the fun stuff: playing and writing. And it’s a special little reward each time I get a notification e-mail from Pulley that somebody has downloaded my song—kind of addictive!</p>

          <p>There’s a lot to love about our <a href="/2012/02/28/coming-soon-new-customization-features/">upcoming customization refresh</a>, but one of our favorite bits is the new power and flexibility it gives our themes. Themes will be able to offer a variety of design and customization options, and to showcase some of these new abilities, we’re excited to introduce a new theme into our lineup - <strong>Sidecar</strong>.</p>
          
          <p class="wide slideshow"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="384" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/03/21/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme-2-8725621e.jpg?auto=format"> <img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="384" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/03/21/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme-3-013a15c9.jpg?auto=format"> <img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="384" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/03/21/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme-4-9c680e93.jpg?auto=format"> <img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="384" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/03/21/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme/coming-soon-sidecar-a-new-theme-5-6fa7f32c.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>Sidecar is a fresh take on showcasing your products and interacting with your customers. In addition to the quick and easy customization you’ve come to expect of all Big Cartel themes, Sidecar also boasts some great new features:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Uploadable images for a logo and a background</li>
          <li>Customizable product grid layout</li>
          <li>Customizable image size for your products</li>
          <li>Multiple font choices for different text areas</li>
          <li>Handy layout and display options</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Sidecar will be available (shortly) to <strong>all stores</strong> with the launch of our <a href="/2012/02/28/coming-soon-new-customization-features/">new design area</a>, and it represents the first of many new themes we hope to offer in the coming months. We want your store to be as unique as the products it holds, and we think Sidecar is a great starting point to help you do just that.</p>

          <p>For over a year now we’ve been working on a new design area for your store admin that will simplify the customization process, for all skill levels, and we can’t wait to get it in your hands. Here’s a glimpse at what we’ve been up to.</p>

          <p>You’ll soon have a brand new way to play with colors and fonts, try different themes, see a real-time preview of your changes, and manage your pages with ease. The new design area will give you complete freedom to try new looks and new content, without having to worry about anyone else seeing it until you’re ready.</p>
          
          <p>Many of you have been begging for something like this for a long time, and over the next few weeks we’ll be dropping a few more sneak peeks while we polish up the final product. This is just the start of many customization features and themes we have planned, we hope they’ll leave you with more time to do what you do best – create.</p>

          <p>Just a few weeks ago we added a new member to the Big Cartel Team. Chris Cameron is here to help make our site more robust, scalable and highly available. When he’s not heroically keeping Big Cartel up and running, Chris is playing super-dad to his five very active kids (between 3 and 16 - yikes!) at home.</p>
          
          <p>Once the kids are dropped off at soccer and gymnastics, Chris spends his free time putting his art degree to use with some drawing, painting, and photography. And if he isn’t designing on the computer, then you can surely find him fly fishing or on the golf course enjoying the outdoors.</p>
          
          <p>We’re certainly happy to have him, so please help us welcome Chris to the <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/team/">team</a>.</p>

          <p>Brand new accounts and newly upgraded plans will automatically use the new billing system, but if you’re already on a paid plan using our old billing system, and you’d like to switch over, just <a href="https://help.bigcartel.com/contact/">let us know</a> and we’ll help you out.</p>

          <p>We recently had a nice chat with the kind folks over at <a href="http://www.blogandbuysale.com/">BlogAndBuySale</a>, and they have now published our interview over on their <a href="http://www.blogandbuysale.com/2012/02/interview-with-big-cartel/">blog</a>. We’ve republished the Q &amp; A here for your reading pleasure. Many thanks to our new friends for taking the time to ask us a few questions!</p>
          
          <h3>Big Cartel was founded back in 2005. What was the original inspiration and drive behind setting up Big Cartel?</h3>
          
          <p>Big Cartel was created because our founders and their friends needed a simple way to sell their stuff online. Our founders, Eric and Matt, both came from music and art communities where a lot of indie artists, full of hustle, would hit a snag when it came to websites and specifically stores for their merch. A simple online store service seemed like a perfect solution to get some money into the pockets of young artists. They found themselves in the right place at the right time and worked lots of late nights to build the first version of Big Cartel.</p>
          
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="323" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/09/big-cartel-talks-to-blogandbuysale/big-cartel-talks-to-blogandbuysale-2-40ffb0b6.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <h3>Do you guys remember the first person to set up a shop with Big Cartel? Are they still a member?</h3>
          
          <p>We originally designed Big Cartel specifically for bands and record labels, but when we flipped the switch and launched Big Cartel our first shop was actually a young, energetic t-shirt designer named Rob Dobi. Rob was the perfect storeowner to help us work through our initial growing pains. We watched him work his ass off to build a successful brand as we did the same. He eventually moved his main brand over to another service to handle all the fulfillment he was doing, but he still keeps a store with us for unique, smaller-run items. ( <a href="http://robdobi.bigcartel.com">robdobi.bigcartel.com</a>)</p>
          
          <p class="wide"><a href="http://www.dobi.nu/"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="90" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/09/big-cartel-talks-to-blogandbuysale/big-cartel-talks-to-blogandbuysale-3-4c4831a9.jpg?auto=format"></a></p>
          
          <h3>What advice would you give to a creative who is thinking about selling their products online?</h3>
          
          <p>Our advice would be to focus on the important stuff and offload everything else. Using a service like Big Cartel helps free up valuable time for an artist. We take care of all the complicated technical junk of building and maintaining a store, which allows artists to focus on the fun stuff: designing products, promoting their brand, and engaging their communities.

          <h3>Why would you recommend Big Cartel to our readers for selling their creative products?</h3>
          
          <p>We’ve worked extremely hard to become the obvious solution for artists ready to start making a living with their passions. We <strong>ARE</strong> artists trying to make a living, we’ve built this <strong>FOR</strong> artists trying to make a living, and we hold every decision we make up to that light. We sort of see Big Cartel as the lightest and most well organized tool belt for a complicated job. When you reach for the pliers, there’s just one pair, right where you thought they’d be.</p>
          
          <h3>How else would you advise our readers to get their products out to the world?</h3>
          
          <p>With the launch of a store comes promotion and marketing. Artists should start right away cultivating communities (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook). Give your loyal friends and fans exclusive sketches and sneak-peeks of your upcoming products. Reward customers with discounts and always be ready to talk about the stuff you’re working on. If you love what you do, and you’re doing it for the right reasons, gushing about your products should be easy breezy. Balance nurturing online communities with local communities. Join craft fairs, approach boutiques and sell from your trunk. It’s a lot of hard work, but it’ll soon start to feel like you’ve become the king of your own empire (which, is sorta true).</p>
          
          <h3>What is the future for Big Cartel?</h3>
          
          <p>We feel like we’re just getting started. We’re starting to see and understand more clearly how we can help our community. We have a huge list of ideas, and an army of supportive artists helping that list grow. This year you’ll see us continue to add highly requested features and focus more on helping artists make a living doing what they love, whatever that entails.</p>

          <h3>Is there anything else you’d like to share with the readers of BlogAndBuySale?</h3>
          
          <p>This past holiday season, as our stores dug in and pushed through their biggest sales time of the year, we put together a simple campaign to promote an important concept: #ShopIndie (shopindie,bigcartel.com). It’s something we feel very strongly about and hope that as more people become aware of the almost 200,000 unique, independent sellers on Big Cartel, we can help shift the concept of buying online toward one that supports more inspired products.</p>

        <div class='body-copy'>
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="344" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/02/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop-1-6320e06c.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>During <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/">Alt Summit</a> I had the pleasure of speaking on a panel with <a href="http://onesydneyroad.com/content/about/1002">Piper</a> from <a href="https://onesydneyroad.com/index.php">One Sydney Road</a> and <a href="http://www.littlealouette.com/story">Amy</a> from <a href="http://www.littlealouette.com/">Little Aloutte</a>. Our topic was titled, <em>“From Blog to Shop”</em>, and we spoke on running a shop, running a blog, and where the two intersect.</p>
          
          <h3>Vision:</h3>
          
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="373" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/02/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop-2-6a493c08.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>The first point was <strong>Vision</strong>. What is your vision, for your life specifically. Here’s the secret, there is no ‘right way’ to run a blog or shop. There are many many people out there that do either one or both successfully and they’ve found a formula that works for their life. What is it that you want out of your business? What’s the end goal? Imagine the life you want and work backwards from there, THAT is your vision.</p>
          
          <h3>Daily Lives:</h3>
          
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="371" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/02/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop-3-2164d43c.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>Second we spoke on our <strong>Daily Lives</strong>. As anyone who runs a blog or shop knows, your day is filled with more than just writing or shop keeping. The day in your life is the niche that makes your experience different. What is it about your interest and daily life that you love? Work this angle with your blog. People want to believe in and support someone, make your readers and your customers part of the process.</p>
          
          <h3>Community:</h3>
          
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="379" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/02/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop-4-769a51b0.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>Which leads to <strong>Community</strong>. This is your support system and fan section, even if the only person standing there is your mom, you have to carve out a space for your community. I love more than anything when I can watch a shop keeper or blogger really go for it and follow their dreams. I know that I am not alone in this feeling. Recognize who your community is and celebrate them. The journey is 100 times better when you have someone to share it with.</p>
          
          <p>—Susan Peterson, <a href="http://freshly-picked.com/">Freshly-Picked.com</a></p>
          
          <p class="wide"><img class="imgix-fluid" data-width="500" data-height="319" data-src="https://bigcartel-blog.imgix.net/2012/02/02/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop/guest-blog-freshly-picked-takes-us-from-blog-to-shop-5-0bf1ed7b.jpg?auto=format"></p>
          
          <p>Thanks to Susan we were able to give away two Titanium Stores For Life at the end of the From Blog to Shop panel. Taking a cue from the book of Oprah, we hid two Big Cartel stickers under chairs before the panel, and the unsuspecting occupants of said chairs were the winners of a Store For Life!</p>
          
          <p>We also want to thank Susan for being our Alt Summit tour-guide and for writing these guest blogs. We hope all of our store owners can take a little something away from the Alt experience via these posts. Thanks for doing what you do and making Big Cartel look so good.</p>

          <p>Attending <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/">Alt Summit</a> is like attending summer camp for designers, bloggers and creatives. Except you’re an adult, so you can stay up late and jump on the beds at the nice hotel. Each year I come away from Alt inspired and excited to implement the things that I’ve learned. This year more than ever.</p>

          <p>Ben from <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> spoke on Friday and he said, ‘If you don’t bet on yourself, no one else will’. A little back story— two years ago, Ben attended <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/">Alt Summit</a> with an idea and a dream, today he is the sitting atop the Internet’s latest game-changer.</p>
          
          <p>So that begs the question, will you bet on yourself? Are you ready to take your shop, your dream and your baby to the next level?</p>

          <p>There are so many great things to learn at Alt, and so many fantastic <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/speakers/">speakers</a> and <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/schedule/">panels</a> that one almost comes away feeling overwhelmed, where do you start? I think the answer is clear, you start right where you are, with you and with what you’re doing.</p>

          <p>Big Cartel spent last weekend rubbing elbows with some of the blogging elite at <a href="http://www.altitudesummit.com/">Alt Summit</a>. It was our first time at the conference, and we learned a lot! As we reflect back on the three days of information and fun, two words continually pop up: <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>community</strong>. It seems the blogging world is demanding these two things, and well, we’re listening. We’ve reached out to our Alt community, and we’re collaborating with three awesome women we met at Alt Summit to help recap the event from their unique perspectives.</p>
          
          <p>Like us, these ladies were all first-timers at Alt Summit, and here they share a bit about what the conference meant to them.</p>

          <p>As a newcomer to Alt this year, I have to say that I had some pretty high expectations. I had been told by fellow Alt attendees from past years that Alt was quite the event and to be prepared for greatness. Now that I’ve experienced this fabulously-fashion-forward conference for myself, I must admit, Alt turned out to be even more then I had hoped for. I was so impressed by the sponsorship interaction, the attention to detail and the vast amount of wisdom and insight shared from the speakers. I left Alt feeling inspired, more connected and, probably most of all, yearning for a far more trend-setting fashionable wardrobe…preferably one that includes some thick black framed glasses.</p>
          
          <p>All around it was an amazing conference with pretty people, parties and priceless information. I will definitely be heading back next year.</p>

          <p>Now that I’ve experienced Alt for the first time, I feel like I can offer some key pieces of advice for those thinking about attending in 2013:</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li><p>Make a list of the people you’d like to see/meet while you’re there. Read up on their blogs. Learn more about their careers, families, and personal preferences. That way, when you find yourself next to Pilar Guzmán while in line for the toilet, you can say, “Hey, how did that bathroom remodel turn out?” rather than, “Holy cow! My bladder is SO FULL. I love your pants.”</p></li>
          <li><p>Think about the cutest outfit you’re planning to bring. Now make it cuter. Now CUTER. Okay, now you’re ready.</p></li>
          <li><p>When it comes to business cards, dream big. Paper is passé. Rectangles are lame. Think about the Christmas gift you loved most from your childhood and then buy 250 of those to hand out to the people you meet.</p></li>
          <li><p>If you are male, you’ll want to practice some immersion therapy leading up to the event. Does your local YWCA have a prenatal yoga class you can audit? How about a Nicholas Sparks book club? What you want here is sheer quantity of ladies.</p></li>
          <li><p>Consider bringing a rolling suitcase, fun vintage red wagon, or sherpa to help carry your swag. Nothing says “Alt Rookie” like a back injury.</p></li>
          </ol>

          <p>I was so hesitant to treat myself to Alt Summit, but a treat is exactly what it was! It was fantastic connecting with bloggers and shop owners in the flesh, but, more than anything, it gave me time to reflect on what I really want from blogging. We can live our online lives in a vacuum, and it was so beneficial to pop up for air. My two biggest takeaways were:</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li><p>Only you can be you. The only way to be both successful and happy is to be yourself, and to bet on yourself. Odds are you’re a good bet. Those little gems are mine, but a lot of inspiring speakers helped remind me of those facts!</p></li>
          <li><p>It’s not a party without balloons. My sister has quoted my balloon philosophy back to me many times, usually mockingly. But in the case of the Alt. Summit mini parties…the proof is in the pictures.</p></li>
          </ol>
