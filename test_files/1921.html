                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e201a511f6d40e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="V__0AA8" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357c046669e201a511f6d40e970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e201a511f6d40e970c-800wi" title="V__0AA8" /></a></p>
<p>After reading this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/08/11/1994-mlb-strike/13912279/" target="_blank">article</a> on the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the notorious Major League Baseball strike, I posted it on my <a href="https://twitter.com/cypresswalls" target="_blank">Twitter</a> feed, coupled with this amateur commentary: “#MLB never fully recovered.”</p>
<p>Later, I realized that this is a moot observation. Baseball seasons will fade in and out for decades into the future, regardless of labor struggles, bloated schedules, overly long nine inning affairs, $5 hotdogs, $10 beers, $20 parking, $50 tickets, and controversies orbiting around age-old vices like gambling, drugs, alcohol and tobacco. And those who don a uniform will continue to enjoy the earthly blessings they’ve been afforded and, hopefully, share in their good fortune.</p>
<p>My thoughts eventually shifted from matters that I will never influence. The ’94 strike was on my mind, but my peevishness evaporated as I instead reminisced on my first and only trip to Tiger Stadium on the corner of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues in Downtown Detroit.</p>
<p>That summer Dad and I committed to a father-son pilgrimage&#0160;that had taken root 10 years earlier when the Tigers barnstormed their way to a World Series victory. We road-tripped from Memphis to the Motor City, took advantage of the $15 room rate I received as a Holiday Inn employee and met up with Grandpa Frey, Uncle Lance and Cousin Chris on an August evening for a tilt between the Tigers and the Brewers. The looming work stoppage dictated the game we chose and the series ended up being the finale before the remainder of the season, including the World Series, was scrapped.</p>
<p>I had forgotten about that circumstance until reading the USA Today story. Whenever I had given thought about that evening the memories that stuck were my grandpa seated in the stands munching on a hotdog, trying in vain to get Alan Trammell’s autograph with my 12-year-old cousin, and the above photograph taken at a relative’s home before heading to the ballpark. The finer points were fuzzy until I sought assistance from the <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET199408080.shtml" target="_blank">Internet</a>. I knew the Tigers lost, but the only other fact I could recall was Travis Fryman hitting a solo homerun that barely cleared the left field fence. Like the strike, those details became insignificant to me over the ensuing years.</p>
<p>The ill-fated 1994 Major League Baseball season is history. There’s no need to dwell on it or its repercussions, but that’s not to suggest that MLB&#39;s leaders should not embrace its past and those fans who long for fleeting moments that transcend the action on the field. Such nostalgia was a big reason why we all returned to Detroit 10 years later and it will also factor into us one day taking a new generation of Tiger fans to Comerica Park. Chris, when do you think your boys will be ready?</p>

                                <p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e2019b0013e2ab970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e2019b00143a34970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Grove" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357c046669e2019b00143a34970d" src="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e2019b00143a34970d-800wi" title="Grove" /></a><br /><br />I try to attend one football game in person every fall. Last year, I hopped a flight to New Orleans and saw the Saints take on the Chargers with my&#0160;buddy JP and his wife at the Superdome. Two years ago, Heather, Mama Lu, Megan and I&#0160;squeezed into Kyle Field&#0160;for Texas A&amp;M&#39;s opener against the less-than-mighty&#0160;Mustangs from SMU. In the fall of 2010, during Megan&#39;s campus tour of Aggieland, we stayed for the weekend and watched the listless&#0160;Aggies struggle in a loss to Mizzou. Thankfully, Megan didn&#39;t let that outcome&#0160;stop her from applying.</p>
<p>When it came time to contemplate a game to go to&#0160;this season, I zeroed in on&#0160;the Aggies&#0160;Oct. 12 date with Ole Miss in Oxford. I was eager for Heather and Megan to experience&#0160;their first&#0160;SEC road tilt and&#0160;realized that&#0160;we could pair the trip with a visit to Mom and Dad&#39;s in Memphis, meaning Grandpa&#0160;Frey could&#0160;come too.&#0160;We&#39;d also&#0160;see the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, Johnny Manziel,&#0160;and, as an added bonus, I thought&#0160;it would be a ton of&#0160;fun to share the&#0160;Rebel&#0160;tailgate scene in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grove_%28Ole_Miss%29" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="The Grove (Ole Miss)">the Grove</a>&#0160;with Heather and Megan.</p>
<p>My first&#0160;encounter with&#0160;the Grove was in 1998. I wrote about the experience in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sides-Cypress-Wall-Joel-Frey/dp/0979522609/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381969711&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=joel+frey" target="_self">Two Sides of a Cypress Wall.</a> Here&#39;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within in five minutes, it became apparent that having her (Merilyn, a family friend/&#0160; Ole Miss alumnus) to usher us from one tent to another, each stocked with plenty of adult beverages and tasty victuals, was definitely advantageous. In between sips of beer and bites of hot wings, we were introduced to dozens of her friends, all of whom exuded the eloquence and grace of true Southerners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifteen years later,&#0160;I think it is safe to say that&#0160;the game day&#0160;population of&#0160;the Grove&#0160;has exploded.&#0160;Bigger, however,&#0160;does not always mean better.&#0160;As we traversed the&#0160;sea of humanity and&#0160;9x9 tents&#0160;in search of the&#0160;spot set up&#0160;for us deep amongst the oaks, the&#0160;vibe felt more&#0160;like Uptown New Orleans during Mardi Gras than a&#0160;festive college&#0160;football Saturday&#0160;on a tree-lined university campus.</p>
<p>Alcohol,&#0160;of course,&#0160;was&#0160;the&#0160;prime reason&#0160;why I&#0160;made that comparison&#0160;and last&#0160;week everyone had&#0160;extra hours&#0160;to&#0160;imbibe&#0160;as kick-off was not until 7:30. By the time we settled into&#0160;the Grove&#0160;around 4:30, there were wobbly steps being taken in all directions. Like everyone else, we had a cooler of adult beverages on hand, but there was no way that we were going to catch up with the glassy-eyed&#0160;binge drinkers who had been going&#0160;pedal-to-the-metal all day long. I tried to recall if I had ever been that hammered in the Grove on my previous visits. I didn&#39;t think so, but then realized that&#0160;if I had been&#0160;I wouldn&#39;t&#0160;have remembered.</p>
<p>&quot;So are we going to stay for the whole game?&quot; Megan asked.</p>
<p>I thought she was kidding. </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; I said, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#0160;if it&#39;s a blowout?&quot; she countered.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it will be,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Four hours later, at approximately 9:30, the game had reached halftime and even though the outcome was in doubt,&#0160;I&#0160;had reached my breaking point. The action on the field was terrific. <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Manziel" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Johnny Manziel">Johnny Football</a> was living up to his Heisman billing, making Rebel defenders miss in all directions. But the pace of the game was painstakingly slow and the action in the stands was maddening: a bevy of f-bombs yelled&#0160;after every play, drinks being tossed into the Mississippi night, and a constant tug-of-war for positioning&#0160;in the sold out&#0160;stands.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m ready when you are,&quot; I told Heather, longing for the comforts of our living room.</p>
<p>Beating the crowd out&#0160;and avoiding the post-game&#0160;gridlock was suddenly more appealing to me than staying until the bitter end. Heather talked&#0160;it over with&#0160;Meg, the Aggies scored a touchdown early in the 3rd quarter to go up&#0160;21-10 and a few minutes later, we excused ourselves. I&#39;m sure the tipsy co-eds behind&#0160;us who almost knocked Heather over earlier were&#0160;glad to see us depart.</p>
<p>As we&#0160;exited, quite possibly the only other sober lady in the entire stadium snapped a&#0160;picture of the four of us. From there, we returned to&#0160;the&#0160;trash strewn&#0160;Grove to pack up. The party was going strong. After enduring&#0160;shouts of &quot;Go to Hell Manziel!&quot;&#0160;we hiked to the car, loaded our gear, unwrapped&#0160;our leftover sandwiches to snack on, found the game on the radio and settled in for the 90 minute drive back to Memphis.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e2019b0013c459970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vaught Hemingway" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357c046669e2019b0013c459970c image-full" src="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e2019b0013c459970c-800wi" title="Vaught Hemingway" /></a></p>
<p>By then, it was after 11:00 and there were <em>still</em> 10 minutes left in the contest.&#0160;It was tied 31-31.&#0160;The Rebels&#0160;scored a touchdown to&#0160;regain the lead, but Johnny Football led the Aggies down the field to&#0160;equalize&#0160;at 38.&#0160;It was actually just as&#0160;nerve racking&#0160;listening to the game&#0160;as&#0160;it was&#0160;being part of the 60,000 in attendance.</p>
<p>The Rebels took the ensuing kick-off, poised to regain the lead,&#0160;but couldn&#39;t muster a drive and punted with plenty of time left&#0160;for Johnny Football to script the next page in his ever growing legend. We all sensed what was about to happen. The Aggies zipped&#0160;the ball down the field into Ole Miss territory, milked the clock to four seconds and put the game&#0160;on the&#0160;foot of their new kicker, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/72350/lambo-an-unlikely-hero-for-texas-am" target="_self">Josh Lambo</a>. With one hand I grabbed Megan&#39;s shoulder and with the other I clutched Heather&#39;s hand. Seconds later, the&#0160;deflated Ole Miss radio announcer robotically verified that the kick was good and that the Aggies had won 41-38. We all screamed with joy. It was hands down the most memorable part of the day - the one moment that I hadn&#39;t planned for months in advance.</p>
<p>We pulled into Mom and Dad&#39;s driveway&#0160;after midnight&#0160;and found the highlights on ESPN. Sure, it would have been&#0160;awesome to witness the winning kick sail through the uprights and to&#0160;sing the Aggie War Hymn&#0160;with the faithful, but we had no regrets.&#0160;A few minutes later we were tucked in for the night,&#0160;proud to be an Aggie family and happy knowing that next weekend our&#0160;team will&#0160;match up with&#0160;Auburn&#0160;in relatively normal&#0160;College Station, far removed from Oxford and&#0160;the sheer&#0160;insanity of&#0160;the Grove.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Have you recovered from the National Week of Suck? Thanks to Heather&#39;s home cookin&#39; over the weekend and a Saints wildcard victory versus the Lions, I feel like the wanderlust of the holidays has lifted. Now, with the divisional round of the NFL play-offs looming, my thoughts have turned to the Saints match up against the 49ers of San Francisco on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>As a young boy growing up in Louisiana, I was almost without fail twice annually subjected to the Joe Montana and Jerry Rice led 49ers absolutely pummeling the hapless Saints. On rare occasion, the Saints scored an upset, but overall the rivalry was decidedly one-sided.</p>
<p>One game, pre-dating the 49ers dynasty years, stands out. It was during the Saints unforgettable 1-15 season in 1980 and though I was only six-years-old, I still recall it. The Saints, led by Archie Manning, traveled to Candlestick Park late in the year sporting an 0-13 record. By then, the locals had notoriously dubbed the team the &quot;Aints&quot; and thousands of fans had taken to sporting brown paper bags over their heads on sojourns to the Superdome. The team had become a punchline and as the losses mounted from week-to-week, it seemed likely that the Saints were destined for the infamy of a winless season.</p>
<p>So imagine the delight of Saints fans young and old alike when on December 7, <a href="http://www.nosaintshistory.com/1980.htm" target="_blank">1980</a> the team raced out to a 35-0 halftime lead over the 49ers. The streak was about to end! The revelers in the French Quarter could roam the streets with glasses held high! The Aints were about to win a game! But then the second half commenced and, unbelievably, the 49ers mounted a comeback, tying the game at 35 by the end of regulation.&#0160; I no longer recall the details of the overtime period, but the 49ers kicked a field goal, won the game 38-35 and sent the Saints back to New Orleans 0-14. (note: the next week the Saints squeaked out a 21-20 win over the Jets and finished the season 1-15)</p>
<p>Cast into separate divisions when the NFL realigned prior to the 2002 season, the frequency of Saints-49ers match-ups have decreased. The teams fortunes have as well. The Saints are just two years removed from a Super Bowl win while this is the first time San Francisco has even made the play-offs in a number of years. In fact, ESPN just informed me that the Saints have won the last six times the two teams have played.</p>
<p>My gut tells me that they will make it seven on Saturday though it will be tough. Between now and kick-off, the skeptical pundits will tell you that the Saints vaunted offense led by Drew Brees isn&#39;t as prolific away from the Superdome. Those same talking heads will also remind you on the Saturday morning pre-game shows that the Saints&#39; three losses this year all came on the road, two against the hapless Bucs and Rams. At some point, they&#39;ll also mention that they&#39;ve never won a play-off game on the road and that they were upset just a year ago by the 7-9 Seattle Seahawks. The ones who have really done their homework might even mention that the last time the two teams played early in the 2010 season on Monday Night Football, the Saints barely eked out a 25-22 win on the 49ers home turf.</p>
<p>I will tell you that all of these points are with merit. But I&#39;ll also say when it comes to the NFL play-offs, it&#39;s never wise to bet against the hottest team playing. The Saints, riding a nine game winning streak and a quarterback in Drew Brees who is playing in his prime, are that team right now. Yes, the 49ers defense is formidable, but I firmly believe the Saints will win on Saturday, once and for all vanquishing the memories of that aforementioned Sunday afternoon 31 years ago.</p>
<p>Final score: Saints 31, 49ers 16</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As a PR professional, my cohorts and I are constantly assessing the &quot;news cycle.&quot; As it ebbs and flows from important and not-s0-important happenings and events, it factors into our discussions and planning everyday. Weather, politics, war, terrorism, and the economy are just a few of the topics that we compete against in our never-ending efforts to get journalists, news producers, bloggers and social media mavens to consider Travelocity for inclusion in a story, segment, post or Tweet.</p>
<p>As you read the rest of this, note that I&#39;ve decidedly missed the news cycle on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. My plan was to follow the status quo and share my observations on that Sunday, but other priorities at work, home and church won out. Now, 10 days later,&#0160; the seasons are set to change and we have moved on to more pressing matters: taxing millionaires, airshow safety, the 2012 election, conference realignment and the latest iteration of everyone&#39;s favorite social network, to name a few. Though in the grand scheme, we likely won&#39;t reflect upon any of these topics 10 years from now.</p>
<p>As Sept. 11, 2011 came and went, I was surprised by own memories that surfaced. For example,&#0160; I vividly recalled the tennis match I played the evening before the tragedy. It was a long three setter against a guy named Sam who I had never beaten. We played to a third set tiebreak and I had a match point, but couldn&#39;t cash it in. When I woke up on 9/11/01, my defeat was the first thought that popped into my head.</p>
<p>I remembered the fall boots my colleague Judy Haveson wore to work and how she paced nervously up and down the hallway as the tragedy unfolded, anxiety covering her face. She was only days away from moving from Texas to New York and, suddenly, all of her plans were in doubt. But a month later, as the nation healed, Judy was in the stands at Yankee Stadium cheering on the Bronx Bombers as they valiantly tried to win the World Series. Today, she&#39;s still a proud New Yorker and mother to Jack, her own little Yankee fan.</p>
<p>I thought about Pastor John Koelpin and the special service I attended at Calvary Lutheran Church. For a few weeks after the towers collapsed, worship and prayer were in vogue. Then, predictably, our post modern sensibilites awoke from their slumber and carried on as before.&#0160; Today I live in El Paso, a married man. On the 10th anniversary, Heather and I sat in a pew at Trinity Lutheran Lutheran Church while Pastor Koelpin still preached from the pulpit of Calvary. His oldest son, Philip and our daughter Megan are now classmates at Texas A&amp;M. In the fall of 2001, they were innocent kids, probably wondering what their parents were so worried about.</p>
<p>I remembered the first flight I took post 9/11, an hourlong hop from Dallas to Memphis on American Airlines. Not only was I nervous, I found myself sizing up my fellow passengers before we boarded.&#0160; After safely arriving to my hometown and having breakfast with my parents, I drove to Oxford, MS and cheered on Middle Tennessee State, my alma mater, as they took the field against the University of Mississippi, led by their All-American quarterback, Eli Manning. Fast forward to the present and he is the quarterback for the New York Giants and commercial airlines have taken me to countless places near and far, including LaGuardia, Newark and JFK.</p>
<p>Thanks for indulging my utter disregard for the 9/11 news cycle. I look forward to writing about more subjects that were yesterday&#39;s news as soon as the opportunity presents itself. If you have any thoughts, please share.<span style="background-color: #888888;">&#0160;</span> Cheers, ya&#39;ll.</p>

                                <p>One of El Paso&#39;s lesser known oddities is that it is the only slice of Texas located in the Mountain Time Zone.&#0160; Generally, this factoid has no impact on how El Pasoans conduct their business, but now and then the rest of the country is reminded of this wrinkle. For instance, last Saturday the Conference USA championship game tipped off at 9:35 a.m. local time. The CBS commentators mentioned the early start several times and how it felt strange for a big game to be tipping off during the breakfast hour.</p>
<p>Heather and I woke up a few minutes before tip-off, brewed a pot of coffee and tuned in, pleasantly surprised to see a packed Don Haskins Center. During the early rounds of the tourney, I had tweeted several times about the plethora of empty seats. &quot;Looks like crickets can be heard chirping,&quot; I said in one. But that wasn&#39;t the case on Saturday. More than 11,000 of the UTEP faithful had woken up early and were ready to rumble.</p>
<p>The game, pitting a senior-laden UTEP team versus an upstart Tiger squad, featured all of the elements of a classic. With an NCAA bid at stake, there was desperation hanging with every shot and constant shifts in momentum. Late in the second half, after a three-pointer put the Miners up by 12, I thought they had finally put away the young Tigers.</p>
<p>By then, I was on my way to play tennis, listening to the game on the radio. By the time I parked, the Miner lead had been whittled down to five. After checking in, I found a TV in the clubhouse. A Tiger three pointer had just tied the game. My thoughts shifted. &quot;What a heartbreaker this would be for the Miners,&quot; I said to myself.</p>
<p>Down one with time winding down, Tiger guard Joe Jackson drew a foul in the lane and sunk two free throws. With 7.8 seconds left, Memphis had its first lead of the day, 67-66. The Miner fans who had gathered around the set looked anxious. A minute later after the potential game-winning shot came up short, their anxiety was replaced with dejection. The Tigers were on their way to the Big Dance and the Miners would most likely have to settle for an NIT bid.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s how it played out. The Tigers get Arizona later this week, while tonight the Miners battled New Mexico at the Pit in Albuquerque in the first round of the consolation bracket. Unfortunately, they lost and the team&#39;s season is officially over. But I think everyone in El Paso who had basketball for breakfast on Saturday knows deep down when it really drew to a close.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For months, I&#39;d wanted to see <a href="http://tillmanstory.com/site/" target="_self">The Tillman Story</a>. After reading several <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/movies/20tillman.html" target="_self">reviews</a> last summer,&#0160; I figured the documentary about the NFL star turned Army Ranger would eventually find its way to El Paso, home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bliss" target="_self">Fort Bliss</a>, the massive U.S. Army post that straddles the Texas-New Mexico border.</p>
<p>I began constantly checking the <a href="http://www.flixster.com/" target="_self">Flixster</a> app on my Blackberry for local show times, but to no avail. At first, I guessed that El Paso was not big enough to warrant a run of screenings. But then, I wondered if the city&#39;s proximity to Fort Bliss was actually a deterrent given the film&#39;s unflattering portrayal of one of the U.S. military&#39;s most forgettable moments during the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Recently, I was perusing Netflix and The Tillman Story crossed my mind. While it wasn&#39;t available until February 1, I added it to our queue, satisfied that I&#39;d finally get the opportunity to watch it.</p>
<p>The Tillman Story is well done and the footage and interviews are compelling, but if you&#39;ve read Jon Krakauer&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Men-Win-Glory-Odyssey/dp/0385522266" target="_self">&quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman,&quot;</a> as I had, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll take away much new information.</p>
<p>That said, there is one unforgettable sequence from Tillman&#39;s memorial service that I didn&#39;t remember from the book. At some point, his younger brother, <a href="http://anyguey.guanabee.com/2010/09/richard-tillman-story/" target="_self">Richard</a>, climbed the stage to say a few words about his fallen brother. With a beer in hand, he&#0160;called out&#0160;the previous speakers, including John McCain, who eulogized Pat as one would expect at a religious service.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s not religious,&quot; he countered. &quot;Thanks for your thoughts, but he&#39;s&#0160;(expletive) dead.&quot;</p>
<p>There is so much about Pat Tillman&#39;s military career that saddens and disappoints me: his inglorious death, the U.S. government then using the tragedy to market an unpopular war and finally the shameless lies that were told by some of the highest ranking leaders in our country as his family tried to sort through the facts.&#0160; As a Christian, however, that scene embodies the most haunting&#0160;and most hopeless part of all.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

<li>Heather and I are slightly dumbfounded that Megan, whose great-grandparents have called the state of Wisconsin home for almost 90 years, rooted for the Steelers.

<li>Last year, we started a new Super Bowl tradition: <a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=jambalaya&amp;cp=6&amp;qe=amFtYmFs&amp;qesig=YDKLgGQeVJ-Hx0sYIfO5Sw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tkzr2ii-QnODsVc4iHhv5zHF1Lui6EgXz6G4GNK75u7V_mc4jhfKbdWuPswfkxmq50eEnjwrDov-J1YHRnOGEucGdyU1g&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=30ZTTfj2AtP1gAeOtpzDCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEcQsAQwAg&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=545" target="_self">jambalaya </a>during halftime. Heather made a scrumptious batch on Sunday and I appreciated having a taste of the Crescent City during the game even if the Saints didn&#39;t make it back to the promised land.</li>
<li>As a lifelong Star Wars fan, the <a href="youtube.com/vw" target="_self">VW commercial</a> featuring a mini-Darth Vader futilely attempting to harness the Force cracked me up. On Facebook I wrote that it was &quot;amazing that Star Wars is still relevant 30+ years after its debut,&quot; to which my friend and fellow Star Wars buff Shea replied, &quot;Much like us.&quot;</li>
<li>El Paso hasn&#39;t quite fully recovered from last week&#39;s plunge into the deep freeze.&#0160; Schools just reopened yesterday and the city finally confirmed this afternoon that it was okay to drink the water sans boiling.&#0160; Unbelievably, some homes and businesses are still without water.</li>
<li>We submitted Meg&#39;s <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_self">FAFSA</a> application last night. For those of you unfamiliar with college application process that stands for &quot;Free Application for Federal Student Aid.&quot; As I was writing this I asked Meg to recite the acronym and she rattled it off. A few seconds later she then passed the &quot;What is your social security number?&quot; quiz.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most Lutherans, I&#39;m an ambassador of potlucks involving pots. We&#39;re having one at <a href="http://www.trinityelpaso.org/trinity/Home/Home.html" target="_self">Trinity </a>(3800 Hondo Pass) on Sunday. If you&#39;re on the Northeast side of town, stop by around 11:30 and fill up a plate. And should your soul need refreshing, the service starts at 10:15.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Late yesterday afternoon when Drew Brees lined the Saints offense up deep in their own territory with about five minutes to play, down by four, my mind flashed back to the Atlanta <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301227001" target="_self">game</a> on 12/27. The circumstances were similar and, as I contemplated the pending outcome, I thought the Saints would squeeze out a close three-point win as they did against the Falcons. &quot;Finish strong,&quot; I muttered as thousands of fans expressed the same <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23finishstrong" target="_self">sentiment</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>Though the Seahawks defense had stymied the Saints&#0160; after they had grabbed two early ten-point leads, Brees and Co. had regained their stride in the fourth quarter. The crowd was anxious. The annoying commentators giddily speculated that the first NFL team to win their division with a losing record could fold under the pressure being applied by the reigning Super Bowl Champs.</p>
<p>But unlike that Monday night in the Georgia Dome, Brees and his teammates were not up to the task. After a listless drive, the Saints punted and with only one timeout remaining, I knew that it wasn&#39;t Who Dat Nation&#39;s day. Marshawn Lynch&#39;s stupifying 67-yard TD run a few minutes later only solidified the notion and was an embarrassing capper to the worst defensive showing the Saints displayed in a long time.&#0160; As a I noted in one of my mid-game tweets, it was so bad that Sports Illustrated football writer <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/peter_king/archive/" target="_self">Peter Kin</a>g was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SI_PeterKing" target="_self">mocking</a> Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams during the game.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure it was a painful flight home last night.&#0160; I wonder if any fans showed up at 2:00 a.m. to greet them at the airport. My only guess is not as many as when they returned from Miami last February after beating the Colts.&#0160; That&#39;s one difference between winning the Super Bowl and losing in the Wild Card round.</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A week before the Saints began their Super Bowl run, we were in Tucson celebrating Megan&#39;s Sweet 16. During the weekend, we visited the Tucson Mall, which, to Meg&#39;s delight, houses a super-sized <a href="http://www.forever21.com/Default.asp?cookie_test=1" target="_blank">Forever 21</a>. While the ladies checked out the teen fashions, I killed time at a sporting goods store, where a simple gray t-shirt, sporting a large fleur de lis across the chest caught my eye. I showed it to Heather and she urged me to bring it home to El Paso, which I did.</p><p>Part of the reason why I bought the shirt had to do with the excitement I felt about the upcoming NFL season. I liked the Saints&#39; chances even though they finished 7-9 and 8-8 in <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/teams/schedule?team=nor&amp;year=2007" target="_blank">2007</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/teams/schedule?team=nor&amp;year=2008" target="_blank">2008</a>, respectively. The previous year had been oh-so-close with the team losing six games by five points or less. They would show flashes of brilliance one week, pummeling the Green Bay Packers 51-29 on Monday Night Football, only to follow it up the next with a gut-wrenching three-point loss to the Tampa Bay Bucs. Despite most of the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/peter_king/02/08/mmqb.superbowl/2.html" target="_blank">experts</a> predicting that the Saints would remain inconsistent this year, I knew that with Drew Brees at quarterback the offense was set and, hopefully, the breaks that went against them in 2008 would take different turns in 2009.</p><p>The first one occurred when the schedule was announced. It was far kinder. For starters, the Saints would not have to travel to London in the middle of the season to play a &quot;home&quot; game as they did in 2008. Not only did the trans-Atlantic sojourn cost the citizens of New Orleans a chance to scream &quot;Who Dat?&quot; for an afternoon, it helped create a six week-long gap between contests at the Superdome. In the end, I doubt this prevented the Saints from making a run deep into the play-offs, but it certainly did not help.</p><p>Perhaps the NFL thought about that when they scheduled the Saints to kick-off the 2009 campaign at home against the Detroit Lions, who in 2008 became the first team in NFL history to go 0-16. The Saints took advantage and won the game 45-27. And though they endured one stretch where they played four out of five games away from the Superdome, they were against the St. Louis Rams, the Bucs, the Washington Redskins, and the Atlanta Falcons, none of whom made the post-season. The Saints beat each of those teams on their way to a 13-0 start.</p><p>Granted, a few of those victories were not without anxious moments. The Redskins, for example, missed a chip shot field goal that would have put them up by 10 points late in the game. Following the choke, Drew Brees promptly hit Robert Meachem on a 53-yard pass to tie the game, which the Saints went on to win in overtime. In 2008, I doubt they would have pulled one like that out.</p><p>As the season progressed, I wore the shirt purchased in Tucson just about every Sunday. But heading into the play-offs - amidst a three-game losing streak - I changed my routine. The shirt remained in my closet on January 16 during the divisional round <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=300116018" target="_blank">win</a> versus the Arizona Cardinals. A week later for the NFC Championship Game, I decided not to wear it myself, instead asking Heather to don it. She cheerfully complied and was a pillar of encouragement for me during the swings of that heart thumping <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=300124018" target="_blank">win</a> against the Vikings. Afterward, we decided she needed her own shirt for the Super Bowl.</p><p>Last night, I returned to the Tucson tee and hung a string of mini-football beads caught at Mardi Gras around my neck. Heather made a batch of jambalaya and we had a few friends from our church over, all of whom were warned by my lovely wife that they would likely see a side of Mr. Frey that they had never seen before. And though I yelled and pumped my fist throughout, I wasn&#39;t as edgy as I had been two weeks prior. Even after the Colts went up 10-0 in the first quarter, I didn&#39;t panic. &quot;Manning is going to get his,&quot; I explained to my sister via text message. &quot;We just have to keep stepping up.&quot;</p><p>Amazingly, the Saints did so in a way I doubt longtime members of the Who Dat Nation thought possible. The onside kick to start the second half is already legendary, but that was only one of many plays that led to the Saints outscoring the Colts 25-7 in quarters three and four. Admittedly, even with a 14 point lead, I had flashbacks to a couple of the losses snagged from the clutches of victory that I had witnessed in my 30 years of Saints fandom. I figured we would at least have to endure one more Colts touchdown followed by an onside kick attempt. But then the Saints &#39;D&#39; stymied Peyton at the goal line and all of those negative vibes I had been harboring in the last three minutes of the game evaporated. The Saints were Super Bowl Champions. Heather never doubted it for a minute.</p><p><a href="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e20120a87879cb970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SB" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357c046669e20120a87879cb970b " src="http://joelfrey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8357c046669e20120a87879cb970b-800wi" title="SB" /></a> <br /> </p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>If I had any friends on Facebook who didn&#39;t realize that I am a lifelong Saints fan, they are now fully aware of this fact. Beginning in the second half of Sunday night&#39;s NFC Championship game, I began a running commentary on my profile page that ranged from optimistic, to encouraging, to frustrated, to forlorn and, finally, exhilarated. As Garrett Hartley lined up for his Super Bowl clinching kick, I was certain he would miss it. &quot;Not in a million years,&quot; I proclaimed to Heather and Megan.</p><p>All I could think about was the field goal he shanked on the afternoon of December 27 against the lowly Tampa Bay Bucs that would have clinched home field advantage for the Saints in the play-offs. After the Bucs won the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=291227018" target="_blank">game</a> in overtime, my Dad and I both realized we had witnessed a Saints game reminiscent of those we watched when we lived in St. Charles Parish 25 years ago. The template for those contests were along these lines: Saints grab an early lead, make a few boneheaded plays and then, eventually, choke away what seemed a certain win. Heading into the play-offs, it was an ominous reminder that even after a 13 game winning streak, we were still pulling for a team that does not have any of its former players in the Hall of Fame. Thankfully, the following evening, Hartley&#39;s miss proved irrelevant when the Chicago Bears pulled out a gritty overtime <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=291228003" target="_blank">win</a> against the Vikings, ensuring that the road to Miami would go through the Dome. After the Bears victory, I thought that maybe all of the voodoo hexes that the Saints have endured over the years were finally lifting.</p><p>When Hartley&#39;s kick sailed through the uprights, I did my best impersonation of Phil Mickelson after he sunk a clutch putt on the 18th hole at Augusta National to win the Master&#39;s. We called Mom and Dad. &quot;That was exhausting,&quot; Dad said. &quot;I kept telling Dad that I wouldn&#39;t want to be Heather and Megan right now,&quot; Mom said, remembering a bunch of Saints-inspired tantrums I threw as a youngster. After we hung up with them, we surfed the Web for a new Saints tee for Heather.</p><p>I won&#39;t rehash all of the commentary from the people who get paid to do it. I am, however, dumbfounded by how much the talking heads love #4, especially <a href="http://www.espnmediazone.com/bios/Talent/Berman_Chris.htm" target="_blank">Chris Berman</a> and <a href="http://www.espnmediazone.com/bios/Talent/Jackson_Tom.htm" target="_blank">Tom Jackson </a>at ESPN. Even last night, a full 24 hours after &quot;the gunslinger&quot; threw the crucial interception that essentially lost the game for the Vikings, Jackson was still, literally, professing his love for him. But that&#39;s okay. Those guys are suckers for good quotes and colorful characters and Mr. Courageous has always fit the bill.</p><p>Thanks for indulging my allegiance to the Black and Gold over the past few days. Hopefully, I&#39;ll have something meaningful to say as it relates to my writing soon. In the meantime, the countdown to Super Bowl 44 continues. Enjoy the ride my fellow Saints fans. We&#39;ve definitely earned a little time in the spotlight. Cheers.</p><p>P.S. I&#39;ve enjoyed this <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/images/01/25/FavreINT.mp3" target="_blank">clip</a> way too much. And this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tlHtfj2vAo&amp;NR=1" target="_blank">one</a> too.</p><p></p>

							<li class="module-list-item"><div class="typelist-note">Despite a solid GPA, several glowing letters of recommendation, and being named “Outstanding News-Editorial Graduate” by his journalism professors, no one seemed to care about Joel Frey after he completed his undergraduate studies.
<br><br>
With no employer seeking his “semi-professional” services, he left school behind and crashed with his mom and dad. He worked a couple of jobs that did not require a degree. He drank too much and escaped to the comfort of old friends whenever the opportunity arose. Most of all, he wondered what it was going to take to shake off the desire to be nothing more than a carefree college kid.
<br><br>
Two Sides of a Cypress Wall is a bittersweet story of coping with the discovery that life in your early twenties is more than just finding a real job.</div></li>
