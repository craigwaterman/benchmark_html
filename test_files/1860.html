		<p>So this post tonight is about me just being a Mom.  Since moving to Arizona, I have noticed some changes in Katelyn.  Absolutely nothing bad &#8211; the girl is so sweet, tenderhearted and deep minded.  She&#8217;s just going through a lot of change &#8211; both in moving as well as physically and socially.  I have now entered that stage, as a Mom, where I want to &#8220;explain&#8221; my daughter&#8217;s behavior to everyone when she doesn&#8217;t seem to be polite, if she isn&#8217;t polite(which isn&#8217;t like her), gets fussy or maybe even bossy to other kids.  Tonight was a perfect example.  She came to me and explained that another girl &#8220;didn&#8217;t look her in the eye and say good-bye&#8221; and then she proceeded to tell the sweet girl (in her face) how she needed to look at her when she said good-bye.  YIKES!   Holy smokes.  My first thought was: &#8220;WHAT?!  Why would she do that?!&#8221;  And then&#8230;I realize that I am pretty stern with her when she doesn&#8217;t look myself or others in the eyes when talking to me/them.  Whoops.  I never thought, in that situation, that I would need to further the conversation and put more emphasis on the fact that we are responsible for ourselves and our actions.  What others do &#8211; they are responsible for and its not our place to correct them.  ESPECIALLY if they&#8217;re older.  Holy yikes.  It&#8217;s these moments I feel like either a failure to &#8220;cover every corner&#8221; with my daughter and/or I realize we are entering a new stage of her life and just when I think &#8220;I got this&#8221;, I DON&#8217;T &#8220;got this&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a whole new stage &#8211; not just for her but for this Momma.  Just when you think you&#8217;ll rolling into the coasting stage, things change and you&#8217;ve got to change the way you did things and get into even more areas you didn&#8217;t have to before.  Especially with a girl.  Lord, help me as she continues to change!  I pray I am SO patient with her and am the best Mom I can be for her.  When she does make mistakes, is maybe not the perfect sweet girl I imagine her to always be, I pray my response to others and her is the best it can be.  I am by no means ashamed of any ill behavior she might have.  We all make mistakes.  She&#8217;s 5 and she&#8217;s learning.  Just, in my mind, it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s not allowed to &#8220;look bad&#8221; or make mistakes.  Or something.  Well this IS certainly a raw post.  Letting it all out here.  I know the people we are around don&#8217;t even think anything of it.  I think I put too much expectations on my little girl sometimes.  She seems so mature for 5 and I am guilty of asking so much of her, myself, at times.  She is such a precious girl.  I really hope to be the best Mom to my blessings.  Yeah, we all make mistakes, Mom&#8217;s are allowed not to be perfect too.  I get all that.  Just realizing I could be better and putting my raw words in this overdue post.  ;)  Here&#8217;s to all the Moms out there!  :)</p>

		<p>It has been a WHILE since I&#8217;ve posted on this blog.  I think that&#8217;s for many reasons that end in the same single thought.  What in the WORLD kind of difference would they make?  Who really cares? My conclusion: I have no clue but writing sure makes me feel better. lol So&#8230;here it is.  My &#8220;raw&#8221;. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>
<p>So, yes, Matt and I youth Pastor at the church.  Youth and youth ministry are a constant in our lives.  We see so many youth needing and wanting change &#8211; in so many different ways.  Emotionally, spiritually, physically, mentally.  The problem?  For a lot, there is little to no change happening.  Words are many, action is small to non-existent.  To me, (here&#8217;s the &#8220;raw&#8221;)its so hard sometimes to counsel &#8211; anyone &#8211; wondering if it&#8217;s worth it because I know that I know that this person sitting in front of me is not ready for change.  Not ready for the hard work.  Not ready to even take the first step.  Looking at the end and seeing how good it sounds and looks but not willing to do the &#8220;hard work&#8221; to get to the goal.  The change.</p>
<p>I remember a very difficult time in my life where I did not want to get out of my bed.  It was too hard to face the day.  I remember telling God and He put this in my heart, &#8220;If you take the first step, I&#8217;ll help you with the one after that and every step after for the rest of the day.&#8221;  So I did.  I changed my mindset.  I determined in my heart AND mind that my body would follow.  And it did.  I took the first step and He was faithful to help me with the next steps after.  Whether you believe in God or not &#8211; that&#8217;s not my point of this blog.  My point is: in order for change to occur, we must change our mindset and follow through with action.  Words can be inspiring, encouraging, etc.  But it&#8217;s the ACTION that will cause change.  If you have no action, you&#8217;ll have no change.  We have so many &#8220;buts&#8221; in our lives that keep us from change.  Those &#8220;buts&#8221; are the good EXCUSES we have not to take action.  Am I saying that change and action won&#8217;t be difficult? (<strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> if we have <em>habits and learned behaviors)</em> Absolutely not.  I say that from experience.  But is change WORTH it?  Uhh&#8230;.yeahhhhhh.  You might have a small mound to cross or a HUGE Mt. Everest.  Whichever it is&#8230;nothing is going to get you to a place of happiness, fulfillment, peace and joy in your life if you don&#8217;t take the action to change.  I will often say to someone who comes to me over and again, &#8220;Here we are, saying the same things, you&#8217;re doing the same things, you&#8217;re as miserable as ever, if not worse.  If you&#8217;re not going to take the steps we&#8217;ve talked about to change &#8211; and not just take step 1, but step 2, step 3 and so forth &#8211; this conversation is pointless.&#8221;  And yeah, some people need to hear it more than once.  That&#8217;s okay.  I am talking about the &#8220;feel good&#8221; conversations to get things out so they &#8220;feel better&#8221; and can continue in the same ways again.  It&#8217;s a pattern that has to be broken.  No change will ever occur in that.  And the fact is, those people are plain miserable.  I feel like shouting, &#8220;TAKE ACTION!  You can CHANGE the path of your life!  You can CHANGE your miserable state into something beautiful!  You can do it!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Believe in the change! And even when you have doubts, don&#8217;t stop with the ACTION!  For me, I could not make the big changes I have made without God&#8217;s help.  I could not walk through the things in my life and come out the way I did without God.  That is not a possibility.  Again, that&#8217;s my &#8220;raw&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple, recent &#8220;change&#8221; for me.  Working out.  I have had some pretty severe hormonal issues, pain, exhaustion, etc with my endometriosis.  It has literally impeded me losing weight.  Talk about discouraging.  I took 3 months off, after a couple of years of working hard, and decided to just do WHATEVER for 3 months.  Eat whatever I wanted, don&#8217;t exercise if I didn&#8217;t want&#8230;whatever.  After that, I had had enough.  I changed my mindset.  I couldn&#8217;t change my situation, so I accepted it.  And I changed my mindset.  My hormones might impede things but SO CAN MY MIND.  So I started Insanity.  Through my exhaustion, I made up my mind that I was going to start and finish it.  Is it hard?  Are you KIDDING ME?  As tired as I get, as much pain as I have at times&#8230;it has been a challenge.  But I MADE UP MY MIND that I was going to start AND finish it regardless of what my stupid scale says.  It&#8217;s more of the accomplishment of the commitment and change in my MENTAL state.  And I do believe that, in turn, it WILL affect my physical.</p>
<p>I do not believe in all of the philosophical teachings of some of these people, but I do love these quotes:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;If you want something in your life you&#8217;ve never had, you&#8217;ll have to do something you&#8217;ve never done.&#8221; JD Houston</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;If you do not change, you may end up where you are heading.&#8221; Lao Tzu</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Procrastination is the thief of time.&#8221; Edward Young</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Procrastination is the bad habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday.&#8221; Napoleon Hill</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Fear stops a lot of people.  Fear of failure, of the unknown, of risk. And it masks itself as procrastination.&#8221; Lisa Anderson</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;"> &#8220;Courage is the commitment to begin without any guarantee of success.&#8221; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</span></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Commitment is doing the thing you said you were going to do long after the mood you said it in has left you.&#8221; unknown</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless commitment is made there are only promises and hopes, but no plans.&#8221; unknown</p>

		<p>As I was scrolling through my Facebook feed this morning while trying to take a minute before having to get up for the day, I came across a friend&#8217;s post stating they felt something big was going to happen in America within a week.  Most of the comments below echoed the same thought.  I sat there with my heart beginning to race a little &#8211; not in fear but in an awakening.  I have been so exhausted from trying to be a good Mom, mother, daughter, friend, etc but have had a very difficult time feeling like I have had any energy at all.  In 2001 the doctor&#8217;s diagnosed me with endometriosis.  For those of you who might not know what it is, you can either google it(I&#8217;m sure all the info online is nice and detailed) or let me tell you the shortened version: you deal with a good amount of pain, normally during your monthly cycles.  For me, it&#8217;s recently been mid-cycle as well as during.  Yeah&#8230;this is getting RAW but hey&#8230;that&#8217;s the name of the blog.  Anyway&#8230;long (annoying) story (that I&#8217;m sick of talking about)shorter, you have pain, extreme exhaustion, nauseousness, hot flashes&#8230;the list is beautiful.  Trying to be a functioning human is a tad difficult.  Having a sick child and trying to be a functioning human is a tad difficult.  Trying to keep the house clean(thanks Mom, Matt and Jovan) and be a functioning human is a tad difficult.  Anyway&#8230;you get the point.  I am definitely not writing this to illicit sympathy but I will say I am blessed to have people and family in my life that care and show it through their words and actions.  My point: I have been so caught up in trying to just function that in reading my friend&#8217;s post today &#8211; a &#8220;recharging&#8221; of my spirit happened.  You know those moments you have a glimpse of motivation(in whatever) and then life happens and it becomes dim again?  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily us being terrible people.  I think it&#8217;s just life.  And so I was challenged again today.  For me, mostly in my Spirit.  I needed an uplifting.  This life IS a vapor.  The past 14 1/2 years have flown by &#8211; the length of time I&#8217;ve been married.  My oldest baby is already 5 &#8211; flown by.  My boys were born 9 years ago &#8211; flown by.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to just live in the moment and focus on that moment.  At times, I do lose sight of the &#8220;big picture&#8221; because of how I physically feel and just life in general, at times.  So, although I am sure I will have my moments still, I am going to try with everything I have in me to focus on truly loving people when I don&#8217;t feel like it, remembering that this life could be here today and gone tomorrow, refocusing on what matters outside of myself.  Maybe in this pain I&#8217;ve been a tad selfish &#8211; in the way that I have allowed my focus to be on what I need in that moment.  Yes, I do give a lot to people and the things that I do in this life, but, to be honest, my attitude has not always been the best.  Oh LORD help me to refocus today.  I have many things I&#8217;d like to do before this world changes or my life ends.  So regardless of my &#8220;feelings&#8221;, I&#8217;ll focus on my reality.  That might be a struggle at times, but hey.  I&#8217;m human.  Help me to keep this motivation past today, God!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever gone through something that was so difficult and, seemingly, no matter how much you prayed, you didn&#8217;t know if your prayers would ever be answered?  Have you ever felt like you were losing hope?  I have had the honor and privilege of doing an adoption photo shoot for a dear friend of mine and her awesome husband, Khela and Jesse Morado.  What they have been through in the past 5 years cuts right to my own heart.  I am sure it cuts deep because of my own story, but regardless of our various stories, it speaks to all of us.  Why?  Because all of us have been through something that has been difficult to walk through.  Whether it was a moment in time that affected us for years to come that needs resolve or healing or seemingly unanswered prayers that we long to have resolved because of the aching in our hearts.  Whatever it is, has been or will be in your life&#8230;don&#8217;t lose hope.    Here is their story:</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>“I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—… You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you; Joel 2:25-26</i></b></p>
<p>We knew in our hearts this scripture would be fulfilled for our aching hearts, but it always seemed <i>just </i>out of reach. After 5 years of longing; through medical tests, surgeries with unexplained failings, cures that always came up short, adoption plans that ended in miscarriages, failures to finalize relinquishments, 4 international dossiers and filings, and the grand finale – an international adoption scam after 15 months of waiting, countless prayers, a gorgeous “Waiting for You” photo shoot in preparation, 2 baby showers, 6 plane tickets and suitcases packed, our savings account, and every ounce of hope we had left of starting a family. To say our lives felt like the locusts had eaten away years…yes, that’s a perfect picture. We were worn, hopeless, devastated, angry, and feeling like this ache in our lives for a child might never be filled.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>I </i></b><b><i>lift up my eyes to the mountains —</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>where does my help come from?</i></b><b><i><br />
My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. Psalms 121:1-2</i></b></p>
<p>Of course, this should have been the scripture that sustained us, after knowing and reciting it for years. However, somewhere in the midst of all this loss, the answer seemed so hidden. We questioned everything we knew to be true of God’s goodness, His providence, and His love for people in such a desperate place of longing. Feelings of bitterness and anger can so quickly swallow up the aching heart.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i><sup> </sup></i></b><b><i>See, I am doing a new thing!</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?</i></b><b><i><br />
I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. Isaiah 43:19</i></b></p>
<p>After many hours of bare honesty and rantings, we decided there MUST be a plan – a reason in the suffering. Had our child not been born yet? Had we placed more value on this little life than what God was really doing in the situation? Was there a reason we were introduced to all these families devastated as well, without knowing the Lord, and we were sent to be a light? We may never know this side of Heaven what the eternal purpose was for all of it. We just prayed to thrive in the midst of such loss and be open to the new things God had planned for our lives…with, or (shockingly) without children.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>…to bestow on them a crown</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>of beauty</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>instead of ashes, the oil</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>of joy</i></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.</i></b><b><i><br />
They will be called oaks of righteousness,</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>a planting</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>of the</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Lord</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><b><i>    </i></b><b><i>for the display of his splendor. Isaiah 61:3</i></b></p>
<p>And then, when least expected, the call. We had been chosen, the baby was due in 3 ½ weeks, and birth mother wanted to meet us. Our initial thoughts – yeah, right. Happened before, things will fall through. We’ll indulge them and plan a meeting, but, we’re not packing away the closet, not buying baby boy things, not opening that room again until we’re <i>holding </i>a child that won’t be taken away. Paperwork sent, days-off scheduled, plans to meet birth mother made, and the wait for more information.</p>
<p>A second call, expected to be our update or a call letting us know things fell through, ended up being a call I could literally recite verbatim. “Khela, I’m calling to let you know &lt;birth mom&gt; gave birth last night. She would like you and Jesse to come pick up your son TODAY.” Standing in a hotel lobby, we melted into a pile of emotions. Hope restored – a crown of beauty instead of ashes, joy unlike anything we’ve ever experience, remembrance of all the losses that led us to this moment, and thankfulness in a God that <i>IS ALWAYS </i>good in the midst of our pain.</p>
<p>Within 10 hours of that call, we were standing in a hospital room as we could hear the bassinette rolling down the hall to our room with our son. A baby boy, who we’ve never seen or met, but God knitted together for our arms to hold. The nurse didn’t even make it to us before the whole room was in tears. As we held him for the first time, it was like every ounce of pain leading to this moment had been forgotten and healed. Just like that – restoration. It’s a word we use so frequently, but fail to feel it’s full implication.</p>
<p>We had been given this gift of grace from a woman we had never met, entrusting us with the most precious gift one can give, a life. There are no words descriptive enough, no gestures grand enough, and no gifts expensive enough to show our regard for her. All we can be certain of, is this was the child we had prayed for so diligently for 5 years. He was the destiny God wanted to fulfill in our lives and for that we are eternally grateful.</p>

		<p>A couple definitions of faith:</p>
<p>1) Complete trust or confidence in someone or something.</p>
<p>2) Strong belief in God or in the doctrines of religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve all been in the place where things are great in life and in those times, faith is easy. What happens when &#8220;life&#8221; isn&#8217;t so easy?  What happens to our faith in those times?  More often than not, if life stays hard for an extended period of time (which is different for everyone), our humanity kicks in and we start questioning the very things we strongly believed in at one point.  In Luke 6, Jesus was talking about listening to Him and putting His words into practice.  Essentially, trusting Him.  Luke 6:48 &amp; 49 state, <em><strong>(48)&#8221;It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock.  When the floodwaters rise and break against that house, it stands firm because it is well built. (49) But anyone who hears and doesn&#8217;t obey is like a person who builds a house without a foundation.  When the floods sweep down against that house, it will collapse into a heap of ruins.&#8221;(NLT) </strong></em><strong> </strong>For many, these words are understood by experience.  For myself and my family, it rings true.  If I could say anything to our youth today about this in this moment, I would say: If you have not had an understanding of this through experience, do not continue in &#8220;towing the line&#8221; or compromising, waiting for it to happen to you before you believe it.  Learn from those you respect, look up to or consider mentors.  How about bringing back the saying, &#8220;learning from other&#8217;s mistakes&#8221; vs &#8220;I have to learn from only my own mistakes.&#8221; This is something I definitely can&#8217;t stand hearing <em><strong>when its used as an excuse</strong></em>, &#8220;I learn best by my own mistakes.&#8221;  Well, I HOPE we learn from our own mistakes.  That would be a complete tragedy!  And who knows us better?  Who can understand why we have done things through our situations, personalities, etc, better than ourselves?  No one.  Like I said, I hear it used as an excuse to continue to rebel frequently and it drives. me. crazy.</p>
<p>Back to the point.  When life is good, faith is great.  There&#8217;s nothing but blue skies, happiness and York Peppermint Patties (that last one applies to me, sorry) <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> .  But when life is hard, that is when the reality of your heart and the depth of your foundation you have laid will come to the surface.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I LOVE life being good but I have never learned so much about myself than in the darkest and hardest times of my life.  Maybe someday we&#8217;ll be able to share that on paper.  For now, I hope you hear my cry for a sincere call to make our foundation deep.  Believe me, it&#8217;s not time to start digging when life throws a loop at you.  You&#8217;ll be too tired and just need to be able to sit in that house on the deep and strong foundation knowing you&#8217;re not going to fall anywhere.  In those moments, this Scripture will speak greatly to your heart, mind and soul: <em><strong>&#8220;And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Philippians 4:7(ESV) </strong></em><strong> </strong>It certainly did for me.</p>
<p>So to wrap up this little blog posting, I&#8217;m going to switch gears a little.  What about when you <em>have</em> a solid foundation and life throws you a loop &#8211; for a long time?  Is it okay to question ourselves and even our faith?  I believe God totally understands.  It&#8217;s not wrong to ask &#8220;why&#8221;, to be heartbroken or even upset.  Ephesians 4:26-27 state to &#8220;be angry and do not sin.&#8221;(ESV) But if we continue in that anger and allow it to become an ungodly anger, we will become bitter and  resentful.  When King David&#8217;s baby passed, he cried out to God but then worshipped Him.  God knows our pain.  Matt and I will often say, &#8220;We know that God was crying along with us when our son&#8217;s passed away.  He wasn&#8217;t just sitting there like an uncaring God who has no love for us and is not &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; with us.&#8221;  That is just not the kind of God we know from the Word and, for Matt and I, have <em>experienced</em>.  When we are angry with God, we are not trusting Him.  There&#8217;s so much more to this topic, but I won&#8217;t get into it now.  The switch in gears: Let&#8217;s say you have a strong foundation in God and yet life is hard &#8211; for years.  How do you cling to the hope(God) in your humanity?  How hard is it?  It can be HARD!  But let me encourage you!!!  It&#8217;s not impossible!  And God LOVES us.  He is the same YESTERDAY, TODAY and FOREVER. He&#8217;s not good yesterday because yesterday was a good day in life and a falsity in our lives the next because life becomes difficult.  I believe in God. (and I&#8221;ll tell you why in another posting) I know there are going to be hard days. He even tells us that.  And maybe because of my stubborn nature, I refuse to suddenly decide against what I know in my heart of hearts is true: God exists.  He loves me more than I could ever humanly comprehend.  And I will love Him and trust Him regardless of the crap this life sends my way.  It might not look pretty and perfect, but I&#8217;ll make it through.  I decided in 6th grade at church camp that I was going to follow God.  And my stubborn nature never let me turn back.  I <em>felt</em> God at that camp.  I sat there in the pew, thought about my decision very carefully and decided that I was going to completely follow and trust Him.  My foundation is set on rock but let me tell you, when life hits you hard&#8230;it&#8217;s hard but it would have been nearly possible to make it through without the love, grace, comfort and peace God gave me in the midst of a very difficult time.  </p>
<p>My next post, I hope you read.  A wonderful friend and her husband went through a very difficult time in life.  Their lives were set on a solid foundation when life hit them hard.  It&#8217;s a raw post from them about their journey.  Their lives and faith bless me so much.  It&#8217;s raw honesty, emotion and faith with humanity.  Their faith speaks to me and I hope you let it speak to you.  </p>

		<p>I love C.S. Lewis.  His conversion was not a nice fluffy story.<em>(which is not bad)</em>  <em><strong>It was one of argument, anger and searching amidst a mind of brilliance.</strong> (which seems to be so relevant these days)</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes wander whether all pleasures are not substitutes for joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What saves a man is to take a step. Then another step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the possible exception of the equator, everything begins somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have a soul. You are a Soul. You have a body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To love at all is to be vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back, everything is different&#8230;”</p>
<p>&#8220;When we Christians behave badly, or fail to behave well, we are making Christianity unbelievable to the outside world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man thinks he is not conceited, he is very conceited indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may forget that you are at every moment totally dependent on God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing. It also depends on what sort of person you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The instrument through which you see God is your whole self. And if a man&#8217;s self is not kept clean and bright, his glimpse of God will be blurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In our own case we accept excuses too easily; in other people&#8217;s, we do not accept them easily enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If God forgives us we must forgive ourselves otherwise its like setting up ourselves as a higher tribunal than him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God, who foresaw your tribulation, has specially armed you to go through it, not without pain but without stain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To walk out of His will is to walk into nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the bad men, religious bad men are the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There would be no sense in saying you trusted Jesus if you would not take his advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly don’t recommend Christianity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted in spite of your changing moods.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This post is mostly a challenge to us who call ourselves Christians.  Why?  Because that&#8217;s what I decided.  lol  Kidding.  It&#8217;s just where my focus is in this post.</p>

Yes.  So I guess that&#8217;s me &#8220;going into it&#8221;.  And I don&#8217;t really care to hear all of the theories that come behind &#8220;it really wasn&#8217;t&#8221;.  No offense, I&#8217;ve read them, and they are disheartening.  So let me get back to the stability.  How about our emotional stability?  &#8220;Reality shows&#8221; alone can do enough damage in the emotional department.  Most of it&#8217;s not even &#8220;reality&#8221;!  And yet we sit and invest in them as if they are and emotional involve ourselves in people&#8217;s lives who live in our T.V.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law came to our church recently and shared the simplest thought &#8211; and yet it had so much impact.  He was talking about injustice.  The injustice that is in our world.  When we think of injustice, of course we are taken to the thoughts of child slavery, child prostitution and a realm of other injustices.  Nate suggested the thought of how we treat those around us.  The injustice we throw out almost everyday.  The irritation we have for someone cutting us off.  The lack of patience we have for people, the selfish mindsets we have that end in treating someone terribly &#8211; either to their face, behind their backs or even in our minds.  What if we started with us?  Here?  What if we changed our thought patterns and watched it affect those around us, how they affected those around them and so on and so forth?  Would this change the world? (you better believe this is making me cringe &#8211; especially on hard, tired and hormonal days)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get back to LOVE.  What is love?  Well&#8230;Merriam-Webster has lots of definitions.  9 to be exact.  Here&#8217;s the first one:</p>
<div id="app">

<div>
<div><strong><em>a (1) :  strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties &lt;maternal love for a child&gt; (2) :  attraction based on sexual desire :  affection and tenderness felt by<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lovers">lovers</a> (3) :  affection based on admiration, <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/benevolence">benevolence</a>, or common interests &lt;love for his old schoolmates&gt;</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>So here&#8217;s my question for those of us who call ourselves Christians: What happens when there is no longer a strong affection for another or the admiration, benevolence or common interests are gone?  Do we simply not &#8220;love&#8221; that person anymore?  (Yes, I skipped over (2).  That&#8217;s a different post and not what I&#8217;m talking about right now.)  I am not talking about the &#8220;sexual&#8221; aspect of love.  My confusion comes when we all sit around and say we love God and we love each other but once someone offends us or does something that irritates the crap out of us, I&#8217;ve watched that &#8220;love&#8221; fly right out the window.  Now let me clarify.  Am I saying that if someone does something to wound you (could be physically or emotionally) that you should just disregard that, buck up and get over it?  Come on.  Absolutely not.  If someone is wounded by someone in that way, there is healing that needs to occur in the person&#8217;s life before anything they view in life is absolutely restored.  I dare say that there is a way to separate yourself from people who have hurt you and still love them.  Let me tell you my challenge in this post: <em><strong>Loving people regardless of the direct or indirect ways they offend you.</strong></em><strong><em><br />
</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Yeah&#8230;I can see all the rabbit trails everyone is going to want to go on.  There are lots of them.  And lots I would agree with.  But here&#8217;s my problem.  This is what I am talking about:  The <em>simple</em> offenses we allow to take a bitter root in our hearts, spew venom right back at them(or to others about them) and maybe even decide that &#8220;that&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;m writing them off. How dare they.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are a few scenarios I&#8217;ve seen in the past weeks:</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Scenario #1: Someone says something hurtful to you.  You get offended but forgive them and your friendship moves on.  A week or more later, they do something that sets you off and you decide to remind them of the crap they either spoke to you or something their actions showed.  </em></div>
<div><em>Scenario #2: You proclaim to be a Christian but are known for gossiping about other people and even being slanderous.</em></div>
<div><em>Scenario #3: You proclaim to be a Christian and talk about those in Scenario #2 with disgust.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>I just don&#8217;t get how we, as Christians, are going to be a light to the world when we can be so backbiting and refuse to start looking at ourselves before trying to &#8220;fix&#8221; other people.  That&#8217;s not love.  Not the love that the Word of God speaks about in 1 Corinthians 13:4.  We often deem this as &#8220;love&#8221; but how much more should we exhibit &#8220;unconditional&#8221; love?  And again, I am not talking about the terrible scenarios that happen to people.  That is a whole other topic.  I am talking about simply loving people.  I am talking about us, as Christians, really and truly LOVING people despite the petty stuff that happens to us from others.  I am talking about the grudges we hold against others. (And this could be for something that is directly done to us, or doesn&#8217;t really affect us at all!  i.e.  Contact me if you want a scenario.  Otherwise, most of us know through our own experiences what I mean by this.) Is this a simple thing?..to let go of the petty stuff?  No.  And what is petty for one person might be huge for another &#8211; I get that.  But bottom line, I think most of us know when things are really petty in the long run.  Maybe trying to figure out our motivations behind holding onto things would be the best way to consider why it might be wrong.  Asking ourselves if it&#8217;s making us bitter.  Asking ourselves if our character is really Christlike behavior.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Is there a way to love someone who is living (what the Bible would deem) a sinful life?  Uh&#8230;YEAH.  How?  SHOW IT.  Why are we so disgusted with those who offend us when we all fall short?  Here&#8217;s one rabbit trail: Why are we so disgusted with those who are openly sinning and (some of us) have to &#8220;put them in their place&#8221;?  I&#8217;ve seen picketing&#8230;shouting&#8230; How in the world is this going to cause someone to &#8220;turn&#8221; from what they&#8217;re doing?  Odds are: it won&#8217;t.  If someone was shouting, spewing and judging me, I would turn right around and walk the other way.  That&#8217;s effective.  Ahhh K.  &lt;end rabbit trail&gt;</div>
<div></div>
<div>So many today, when they hear the word, &#8220;love&#8221; think of the sexually relational aspect.  (which isn&#8217;t wrong)  And why wouldn&#8217;t the younger generation, especially, when everything is so sexually driven in the media and the world.  What I&#8217;m talking about is the basics of loving people.  What&#8217;s the Bible say?</div>
<div></div>
<div>So&#8230;what is your definition of the basics of love?  as a Christian?  And do you really live it out?  You better believe I&#8217;m asking myself&#8230;</div>

		<p>So&#8230;another blog.  Whoop-dee-do.  I SURE HOPE NOT!  The whole purpose of this blog will be to challenge and to start some good conversation!  We&#8217;ll cover all sorts of topics we face in life and, of course, we&#8217;ll dive into the Word of God to see what it has to say about well, life.  These blogs will not be pages long.  My hope is that for those of you who are constantly connected to the internet &#8211; most of us &#8211; will be able to come here, read some simple thought provoking ideas and RESPOND!  I want this to be a place where questions can be asked and hopefully answered.  If the questions provoke more questions &#8211; that&#8217;s fine!  I think it&#8217;s always good to be moving forward in a Spiritual journey instead of being stagnant &#8211; me included.  In this day and age, our youth and 20s/30s are searching for answers to a confused world&#8217;s interpretation of who God is and who God isn&#8217;t.  Actually, I just see it more in these ages because we are around them on a daily basis.  I think there&#8217;s confusion mixed in from ages 0-120.  There are many who know the Word and many who do not.  The simplicity of the Gospel has been made difficult.  How to live a life that reflects Christ needs to be reexamined.  We all make mistakes, but I believe the Teens and 20s/30s of this day need a road back to a simple faith.  And I hope that Raw Twenty.Thirteen will be a place to challenge and create conversation.  I&#8217;ll also post some media, videos, links to resources, etc. (not that I am the know all in these areas.  lol  But after researching many of these things, hopefully it&#8217;ll help same someone some time.)  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!</p>
<p>The first subject will be: love.  And while I&#8217;ll <em>never</em> smash anyone over the head&#8230;it&#8217;ll all be raw.</p>
