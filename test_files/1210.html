<p>As my 4th pregnancy is nearing the end I have bittersweet feelings. I can&#8217;t wait to meet and hold my little man or lady, and definitely I won&#8217;t miss having to pee 4 times a night or hearing my now pliable pelvic bones move and crunch when I try to pull myself out of bed in the morning. But, there&#8217;s so much I will miss. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing this will be my final pregnancy and that brings tears to my eyes. I love being pregnant. It&#8217;s such a special time in a woman&#8217;s life. I love looking at my enormous baby belly and knowing that I am doing the most important job of my life&#8230; Making life. I&#8217;m a human incubator and it is such an honor. I also love feeling my baby kick and play and move inside of me. After doing this 3 times before it still amazes me. I pull up my top every time I feel movement and gaze in awe as my belly ripples back and forth, and I can see what appears to be small rolling mountains of little hands and feet travel across my stomach. I love never feeling alone and I love how everyone smiles at a pregnant woman no matter what mood they are in. I love how everyone calls me &#8216;mama&#8217; and how my husband rubs my belly and tells me I&#8217;m the sexiest woman he&#8217;s ever seen. I also have so much fun dressing my baby bump. I usually opt for vintage and make it a mission to show myself and other preggers that you can totally look stylish at any point during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;m in love with pregnancy. Funny enough, <a href="http://www.torispelling.com/post/tori-spelling-advice-to-my-21-year-old-self" target="_blank">if you had asked 21-year-old Tori</a> if she would one day be the mama of 4, she probably would have laughed at you on her way out the door to go have whisky sours and dance at The Roxbury on Sunset with Shannen Doherty and Brian Austin Green. I mean&#8230; I always knew I wanted kids but I never could have predicted that I&#8217;d want such a large family and how much I would love being pregnant, and then taking care of and raising babes. </p>
<p>I live for my children. I beyond enjoy every single moment with them. I love the big moments like watching them talk and walk for the first time and even the small things like watching them discover their toes or hearing Liam say, &#8220;Mom, mom, mom&#8221; 50 times in a row. I even love when Stella says, &#8220;Mom I pooped&#8221;, and I walk into the bathroom to find her off the toilet, grasping her ankles with her naked butt in the air, awaiting a wipe. </p>
<p>I know all of these moments are fleeting. They won&#8217;t last forever. Just like my pregnancy. So I&#8217;m enjoying my last moments as a pregnant woman. I know very shortly it will be over and just a memory. I hope I can hang onto that amazing feeling I feel as an honored pregger and can remember forever the enjoyment I got out of it. Actually I know I&#8217;ll remember the enjoyment I got out of it as I watch my 4 beautiful babies grow into adults and have babies of their own. Yes, these moments can&#8217;t last forever, but the greatest part is that new moments with them will be created for the rest of our lives together. And where pregnancy is concerned, hopefully I WILL forget the dry nipples, constant heartburn, and constipation! </p>
<p>And since this will most likely be my last pregnancy, I wanted to dedicate the entire week on ediTORIal to blogs about pregnancy and being a mama. And to make sure that I never forget how I felt during this 4th pregnancy, my family and I are going to be filming some very special home videos for all of you guys documenting the final weeks before babe arrives! I&#8217;ll be posting these videos to ediTORIal, so stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite thing about being pregger?</strong></p>
<p>Love,<br />T</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14193" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I can certainly relate to what you are going through these days. I woke up this morning thinking all about pregnency and the joys of growing a child. I am scheduled to deliver our third child in 3 days and I am anxious, excited, and a little sad that my pregnancy will be over. This will be my last pregnancy as well and being a women it&#8217;s a bit hard to think about that. Being pregnant is one of the greatest experiences I&#8217;ve ever had and I am so thankful for the babies I have brought into this world! I will certainly miss feeling the baby move and hiccup but there is nothing more special than holding them in my arms! So congrats to you and your family! You guys are super cute! Looking forward to seeing your new addition! You two make such cute babies <img src="http://torispelling.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>My second favourite thing was nesting. That maternal instinct that makes you crazy with trying to organize, clean and cook as much food as you can &#8211; and it seems to have never left haha. </p>
<p>I was so sad to not be pregnant anymore and I cherish that time in my life, not every woman gets to experience it &#8211; we are BLESSED!!!</p></p>

I was so fortunate to be very fertile <img src="http://torispelling.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and be complication free for both of my pregnancies.  I would say the thing I miss the most about being pregnant is feeling the baby move esp for the first time.  I would just lay on the bed and watch my bare belly move.  Amazing! I will also miss the first time they placed my babies on my chest when they were born and just the warmth that I felt from them.  Loved it so much.  Unfortunately, due to unexplained complications that I had after my deliveries, I will not be having more babies.  I am just so thankful to have my boy and girl whom I love with all of my heart!</p>

<p>Best of luck to you as the pregnancy winds down.  I look forward to upcoming videos.  Your family is such a joy to watch.</p>

I loved every moment of each of my 3 pregnancies, and am coping with the sadness of never doing it again. (My husband had a vasectomy after #3.)  Personally, I feel that growing little human beings is the most important job ever and the greatest experience of my life.  My baby just turned 1 and I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting the first time he says &#8220;mama&#8221;.  I am one who tries to appreciate each moment because things are constantly changing.  Congrats on baby #4!!  If I could afford it, I&#8217;d be right there with you!</p>

My sister in law thought she couldn&#8217;t get pregnant but after 10 years of not preventing it she got preggers! We were all excited and looking forward to the september delivery and meeting her at thanksgiving.  That all ended a week and a half ago.  She went in for her weekly exam and everything was going fine as usual.  Until they couldn&#8217;t find a heartbeat. 3 weeks from delivery the heart stopped.</p>
<p>My sister in law is my hero because she went ahead and let them induce and go through 6 hours of delivery knowing the outcome.  That our precious niece would never take a breath of air.</p>
</p>
<p>Doria Charis(pronounces carees) Stumpf  was delivered at 3:43 pm on August 18, 2012 weighing in at 3 pounds 10.5 ounces. She was 17 inches long. Her name means Gift of Grace.</p>
<p>I have never known a casket could be so small (can be carried with 1 hand.. maybe 2 ft long?).  I hope I never have to again.  It had a gorgeous pink frilly design on it and my husband and I put 2 single soft pink roses tied together on top.  The florist cut the stems to the perfect length as they fit perfectly on top of the casket.</p></p>

My husband was the best part of being pregnant. He was so loving, helpful and excited and it was a really great time for us to really &#8221; super glue&#8221; our relationship together. hee hee&#8230; Now 5 years later my heart is skipping a beat today as our daughter prepares to start Kindergarden tomorrow and I am having all kinds of emotions about that.

The thought of this tiny human being growing inside of me, the special attention others often give you, feeling the baby move. What an honor it is to be able to bring a new life into the world. My pregnancy days are long over. My youngest are 26 years old. In those 26 years I often missed being pregnant but I knew having more children was not in the plan for me for numerous reasons. In 2009 I had to have a complete Hysterectomy and although I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to have more children and I was to old to any way, still the thought of no longer having the parts to make a baby made me feel very sad. It was like an end to a chapter in my life, a door closing and welded shut, never to be opened again.</p>
<p>I chuckled when you mentioned Stella going poo and sticking her butt in the air to be wiped. Those little every day things our chicldren do are so cute. I can remember my granddaughter screaming at the top of her lungs from the bathroom; &#8220;I pooped!&#8221;. Those little normal every day things I think we tend to take for granted even milestones and please do not take that wrong. The reason I mentioned it is because on of my twins is disabled. I would have given anything to hear her screaming to me that she had pooped and needed wiped. Hearing her say &#8220;I love you&#8221; for the first time when we weren&#8217;t even sure she would ever be able to talk. That made the first time even more wonderful. There have been many &#8220;firsts&#8221; in her life and many &#8220;firsts&#8221; she will never experiance like walking, crawling and sitting up on her own.</p>
</p>
<p>Your children are beautiful Tori! I miss seeing them on your show, heck I miss the whole show lol. Its so awesome to see people like you and Dean lead a fairly normal, regular life and raise your children mostly yourselves. Liam just cracks me up with the things he says. Stella&#8217;s fashion sense for her young age is so cute! Cannot wait to see the newest human addition to your family <img src="http://torispelling.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Having children was never a dream of mine. As I was getting older, I was more assure that I would never have a baby and that&#8217;s fine with me. But let me tell you something, it was the most beautiful thing that I&#8217;ve ever experienced! My baby girl has now 7 months 1/2 and it&#8217;s gorgeous (of course!). </p>
<p>And Tori, if your baby is to be born in August, it will be a fantastic baby, kkkkk. I&#8217;m a Virgo, from 24th August.</p>
<p>Sorry for the mistakes, you guys, I&#8217;m from Portugal so&#8230;</p>

There are many women, myself included, that would love to be in your position.  I have a suggestion for you.  Since you seem to handle pregnancy so well, have you ever considered being a surrogate mother?  I think you would be a terrific surrogate mom.  It sure would make an interesting angle for your TV show.  <img src="http://torispelling.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  We&#8217;ve been trying for 7 years to have another baby.  I would pick you to be a surrogate for my baby in a heartbeat!  Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy!</p>

I did have a very short lived pregnancy one year after we started trying for our second.  IUI and IVF also failed.  Anyway, you are so very blessed to be so fertile.   Something tells me this won&#8217;t be your last ;-).  Can wait to meet the newest McDermott!  Congratulations!!  Enjoy every moment. </p>

I loved walking around knowing I was doing this important job, carrying a life; and how people treated you nicer, (and the closer parking spaces!), and when you can feel them move, the BEST.  I have two, my youngest turned 3 in June and we&#8217;re done trying and it makes me a little sad, but I am SO grateful for them!  They make me smile like no one else can.  Congrats on your beautiful family!  Excited to see the new addition!!</p>

Wish I could be pregnant one more time, but not sure if fate will bless me again.  Enjoy your last days and cherish every moment as I&#8217;m sure you are.  Money and pssessions are just that, its our children that carry our memories and legacy.  God bless and a easy delivery for you !</p>

<p>You and Dean are bless with beautiful babies&#8230;inside and out. I am sure that you guys will raise them to be kind, decent, brilliant, and most of all, themselves because you guys are always yourselves.</p>

I love the way you talk about your pregnancies and your children and what each one means to you in such a different way.  I am a stay at home mom and have two girls and they are my whole life.  One is starting 7th grade today and my oldest is starting her senior year in high school and then will be off to college.  This is by far the hardest year for me, especially after making college visits this summer&#8230;I own need to own stock in waterproof mascara!  When you have been a part of a persons life for 17 years, each and every day and everything, it is hard to wrap your mind around not being there for every moment.  My husband and I will see her off to college in a year and I will stand back and marvel at the young woman that I brought into this world and raised to be the best person that she can be and know that I have done the best that I can.  GOD has his own plan for her and I must not stand in the way of her future.  She will fall and she will get hurt&#8230;and she will be just fine and she will know I am always here for her and her sister.</p>
<p>Enjoy every moment with your precious children!</p>

I was pregnant at the time, but not showing however you honed in on it.  You asked me if it was hot in there or if it was just the wine and then you said oh you aren&#8217;t drinking wine you&#8217;re pregnant how cute.  I don&#8217;t recall what movie you were there for but my ex husband was one of the executive producers for In The Company of Men&#8230;. We stayed in Indiana however, and he went back to working on computers.  Anyway that child is now a freshmen in highschool, and I have 4 others.  My last pregnancy was a late in life child the 4 boys are all older than her.  I felt the same sadness 2 times.  My boys are 18 (off to boot camp for the Army National Guard as we speak) 15, 13, 10 and then my daughter is 2&#8230; Pregnancy is the most amazing thing you can do in this world.  Hold on to every moment Tori, and congrats to you and your family!</p>

Now that my kids are growing up, I find myself recalling my pregnancies and my babies (as they were).  Even as hard as my pregnancies were (both full bed rest for 35 weeks) I would never take them back.  As I watched my son go off to college last week, I still see him as a pudgy little baby scooting around the house.  As I look at my daugther, now going into high school I am reminded off all the wonderful things she has accomplished in her life so far, published in a book, awards for her clarinet playing, but I can&#8217;t help remember that tiny bundle when she was born and didn&#8217;t breath for the first few minutes.  Congratulations to you Tori and your family and hold on to every moment &#8211; they pass to quickly.</p>

My husband and I watch your show, and simply put we adore your family. There are many parallels between us..my husband and I fell in love while with each other while in the midst of very unhappy relationships. We cleaned up our past, moved in together and started a family almost immediately..we just knew it was right. I always knew I wanted a family, but was unprepared for the love and joy I would experience. I have never been so grateful of anything in my life. My children are my world, we sacrificed my income so I could stay at home with them and shower them with love every day. And even though our bank account is small, our house is overflowing with love. I had two babies back to back..and unlike you I was NOT a fan of pregnancy. I cursed under my breath each day until it was over..but I was beyond elated at the final result. I ended up getting my tubes tied during my last csection, and now regret that decision immensely. I would love to have more babies, to share the love that my husband and I have with another little life..but I will simply focus on the two that I am blessed enough to have. My family is the greatest gift of my life&#8230;and it feels so great to see families share the close bond that i&#8217;m lucky enough to experience. You are inspiring to us all, a gracious person and a wonderful wife and mother. Your family is a joy to watch. Congrats to you all..you deserve all of the happiness life has to offer.</p>
<p>And to all of those ladies on the fence about getting your tubes tied, make sure to think long and hard about it and not make the decision based on short term pain.</p>

I was in an abusive relationship and truley believe that this is why&#8230;.so much so that I tied my tubes at 22. I felt the next man in my life would just have to accept the fact i was no longer going to bear his kids. I met my now husband when i was 24 and I told him I would not be having any kids, I was done. He was the only man I dated that was ok with this, he said he could live with that and he loved me the way I was. I think this is why when I turned 30 I felt i had missed out. I felt I had been jipped out of the family setting, having that one person you love dearly and being able to share a family together. But being 30 I felt i was too old! But, my feelings never went away. We decided to undergo a tubal reversal surgery and to my pleasant suprise, I was pregant the following month! I have to say being pergnant with a man you love is the most wonderful experience! I loved every minute f it, even giving birth! We went on to have 3 kids together, so now I am the mother of 4 beautiful girls. I sometimes think what my life would be like had we only raised my first daughter together, and as much as I love her I know my life is now complete and even though people say I could have a peaceful life if I hadnt had anymore, I wouldnt change a thing! I had my last baby 4 months ago, and it is bittersweet knowing it will be the last one, but I have 4 girls to raise now and there is some comfort in knowing your family is complete and you can focus on and thank God for the blessings you are given. I truley feel blessed <img src="http://torispelling.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Good luck to you and your beautiful family Tori!</p>

We are due to have baby number two (a girl!!!) in 12 days. The waiting is the hardest part, but now that I&#8217;m at the end, I almost don&#8217;t want it to be over &#8211; despite the many aches and pains I feel.</p>
<p>For me, te best part of being preggers is feeling my little baby fluttering around inside of me. It&#8217;s the most amazing gift in the world to be able to give life. I may want another&#8230;I am only 34, but my husband is 40 and thinks he&#8217;s too old to have more kids. We&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;m not convinced that this is the last! I love being a mom more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve enjoyed following along with you as we&#8217;re preggers at the same time. Thanks for the inspiration. You are beautiful and a true role model mama!!</p>

It does not feel like a year ago that I brought her sweet baby face into this world. I have Osteoporosis and do not think I am going to be having any more babies. Of course I did not know this when I was pregnant and now I feel like I should have &#8220;liked&#8221; being pregnant more LOL Kids are hard to raise but I am so excited to teach my little ones everything that I can to prepare them! This was a beautiful article you wrote and it touched me and obviously many others!</p>

I was you, just a year ago&#8230;he was our surprise baby with my youngest being 6 when he was born and oldest 10&#8230;8 year old in the middle but he has been nothing but pure joy and a blessing that we all cannot imagine life without.  I have hard pregnancies&#8230;mainly at the end/last trimesters with severe edema and this last one high blood pressure(older now:) ) and I am truly in pain and discomfort as a pregnant woman but ever since my little guy was born, I have struggled with the end of this era of my life, this chapter that is now over.  I just turned 41 and after this one, my husband had his procedure and it was the hardest thing I could imagine.  To know we were done with this part of our lives&#8230;.so so hard.  And even though I am not a good pregger, I 100% miss every second of it and always will.  I agree fully with your words on how special it is to be a pregnant woman&#8211;the looks, the smiles, the joy people get to just look at a pregnant woman.  It is so special.  And the feelings you mentioned of the kicks and movements and knowing you have the most important job of actually creating and sustaining a life&#8212;it is beyond amazing.  I miss it all.  And despite my misery during it, I would do it all over again to experience it just one more time.  I&#8217;m with ya mama!  I get it&#8230;.totally get it!!  God bless&#8211;can&#8217;t wait for the videos!</p>

I loved that feeling except when the baby hit the bladder. That hurt! lol Seriously, though I miss feeling extra special because I am creating life. I have 4 kids and my youngest will be 2 in October and I get so sad because I will never expierience being pregnant or the joy of giving birth again. I really don&#8217;t want another baby but I do miss the whole process of pregnancy, birth and nursing a newborn. Its all so sweet and I find myself ready to move on to the next chapter of raising my kids but grieving the end of the chapter where I gave birth to them.  </p>

It was truly amazing to watch and feel my baby move around in my belly. Sometimes I would get a good punch and other times it kind of tickled. My babies were inactive while I was work. But the moment I got home and settled down they got actived. I did not mind that they were active when I got home. It was like they waited to be active so their dad could be there to share in the excitement. I truly miss the baby stage. Today my babies are 15 and 13. It has been the best job of my life to raise my beautiful daughters. I am so thankful that I beat Breast Cancer so I can watch them get their driver licenses, graduate high school, go to college, their weddings and hopefully watch them raise a family of their own. I am not with my daughters&#8217; dad anymore we could not make it work. I am now married to the most wonderful man ever. He has been our rock through my cancer diagnois and a wonderful step-dad. He treats the girls like his own. I wish everyone who has a blended family could have a positive relantionship like my family does. But I know that is not the case. I am unable to give my husband a child of his own due to my health issues. We have thought about adoption. We have so much love to give and how wonderful it would be to bring a child into our home that just wants to be loved. So to everyone that is preggers, please enjoy every minute of it. Don&#8217;t let the aches and pains get to you. Just remember what you doing, you are creating a life. The greatest gift of all.</p>

Five years later and we had twin girls!!!! I had always loved the name Elyse and I found the name Eryn in a book, so we ended up going with Arden Elyse and Eryn Brooks.  The name Arden came from an older friend of ours whom we thought was just an awesome person and had a really cool name and then Brooks was my husband&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s maiden name.  Over the years we have gotten quite the respone on our names for our girls.  I think we did a pretty good job! Good luck with your precious fourth.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what you come up with!:-)))</p></p>

I loved being pregnant for the same reasons. (However I didn&#8217;t even mind having to pee incessantly.)I only had &#8220;morning sickness&#8221; with my first, but never had any issues until my last. I had all of mine naturally except the last. I had to have a c-section. (I don&#8217;t know why women opt for this even if they don&#8217;t need one! I think it was much more painful as far as recovery) But to think ,that as a woman we have so many natural functions for our bodies. We have a Menstrual cycle, we have babies and we nurse. We are incredible creations! I celebrate your 4th baby with you and your amazing family. Thank you for inspiring others by sharing your experiences. Blessings!</p>

I had prepartum depression- which instantly vanished when baby was born- and constant sickness with all 3. I enjoyed feeling baby movements, seeing feet and elbows pushing out of my belly and rubbing the basketball that became my belly and always having a casual relaxed place to rest my arms and hands. Everything else was terrible 24 hour a day for 9 month sickness- depression like you would not believe. I was terribly moody (that is be being nice to myself here) and my hubs and i constantly fought. He hated me while i was pregnant and our marriage almost ended with each pregnancy so seeing it come to an end was not a sadness or bittersweet for me at all. I know I am done with children and just wonder why you feel this will be your last. Can&#8217;t wait for those videos- I really miss your show 😉</p>

Both girls were the loves of my life. Mine was not a happy marriage, but with hubby on the road my world revolved around my 2 girls. When my girls were 10 and 8, baby number 3 was born, another girl. A year later, number 4  and our first boy and then finally 22 months later another boy to finish our family. I enjoyed being pregnant except when he was home. The children were always fascinated and excited as we added to our family. They enjoy being part of a large family and we are all very close. (After 20 years of marriage, he decided he didn&#8217;t want to be married anymore and hasn&#8217;t seen the kids in over 2 years. His loss because I have raised 5 great kids!!!!) I am a single mom and my world still revolves around my children and now 3 grandchildren (ages 15 mos, 4 and 6). And at 45, I am teaching inner-city children in the Federal Headstart pre-k program and going to school for my degree. Kids are my life!!</p></p>

After giving birth for the first time, that was when I lost a lot of my insecurities you mentioned in your &#8217;21-one-year-old-Tori&#8217; post. It all came into persepective somehow. (Little did I know that they got replaced by lot bigger insecurities like the fear of something bad happening to them, but let&#8217;s leave that sombre thoughts for another contemplative moment.) Now it&#8217;s the time to celebrate life, when you are on the verge of bringing yet another one on sublunary grounds!!</p>
<p>At the end of my third and last pregnancy I remember taking a shower and see all the water flowing over my bump-soon-to-be-baby thinking &#8220;this is probably one of the last moments I will see this in my life&#8221; and I really cherished that moment. Five years later I still can bring back that moment instantly! Super special.</p>
<p>In relation to all that you wrote I&#8217;d like to add that sometimes when I cuddle up with one of my kids, I love talking about all these feelings during my pregnancies with them and they ask me to do so sometimes. All three of them had something special and I keep reminding them about that, to let them feel special as well: the eldest boy made me a Mum 10 yrs ago(he thinks it&#8217;s funny I wasn&#8217;t one before that), my eight year old was my first and only daughter and our youngest son is special because we really wanted him as an addition to our family and he is the icing on the cake, for all of us.</p>

This last pregnancy was by far the hardest, but also the sweetest. Delivery? Piece of cake. But I am truly stopping to smell the roses (even if they smell poopy!) with this little guy. He&#8217;s the last, and he truly is the apple of my eye. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I love the other kids to pieces, but my baby is my last baby, and that will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>I understand exactly how you feel. I too absolutely loved being pregnant. I have six children myself. I would have had more too, but I found out my oldest son has Duchennes Muscular Dystrophy, which is genetically passed from my genes. Any boys that I have can be born with this crippling disease. I had to call it quits. Luckily, girls arent as prone to actually have the disease, but they can be born carriers of it like I am. So far only one daughter is a confirmed carrier. But my oldest daughter was fine and I am now a proud grandma, so at least I can enjoy him. Being pregnant was the only time in my entire life that I actually loved being me. I don&#8217;t have high self esteem and never did like myself. My babies are the only thing that I was ever proud of myself for. Good luck to you and Dean. I miss seeing you guys on tv and hope you come back one day. I love your family and hope to meet you one day. </p>
<p>Yours Always,Vanessa  Berkenmeyer</p>
<p>Depauw, Indiana</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14249" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>First I love this picture of you and Hattie! I also loved being pregnant, I have 4 children as well. 2 Girls and 2 Boys, I am now 58yrs old and  embraced every moment of their growing up. My girls came first and they are now 31 and 30, then came the boys who are now 25 and 21 in a few weeks. All four are completley different in many ways and were raised to be their own person. All four went to college and have 4 different carreer paths. My one daughter is a make up artist and travels all over the country for shows and seminars. My second daughter works in Manhattan in finance. My one son is a professional fly fisherman in Mt and flies all over the world to fish and my last son is still in college, wrestles and wants to be and probably will be a college wrestling coach. They all are close even though they do their own thing but always remember special occasions and make sure to keep in touch with each other. We are all always together for the Holidays and just love being together as a family. I was sad at first when the family started to scatter and yes I did have the empty nest feeling but that has since passed. I married my HS sweetheart and have been married 38yrs, he has always treated me very special and having someone who really cares made the transition easier.  My husband and I have lots of fun doing things together and we each have our own interest too. I have 3 grandchildren and it&#8217;s so cool to see your children raise children. It does go very fast, but I knew that, I did cherish every min. of being a mom and it was my most rewarding experience of my life. I still am a mom and that&#8217;s what I had to realize, I still talk to my girls everyday and all 4 children treat me very special. My husband always says I am the best mom he has ever seen and I love that. One thing my kids always knew was life didn&#8217;t revolve around them only, we are a family and this is the life their dad and I created.  My husband is my best friend and they know it. Enjoy your babies, four is a great number!</p>

Yesterday, we celebrated the delivery of our stillborn daughter, Molly. I posted about her on my blog, and then got your alert e-mail in my inbox, and didn&#8217;t want to read it at first, because I thought the post might be negative, but it really was so nice, and made me smile on a hard day. Thank you for that!

My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for almost three years. It leaves a sad and hollow feeling when I see others announcing they are pregnant, or pregnant mammas walk by me. I hold on to hope that one day I too will have that feeling of growing a child, and then holding it in my arms. We have been through all of the tests, and a few unsuccessful IUI sessions. There is nothing wrong with either of us, just &#8216;unexplained infertility.&#8221; I have tried every trick in the book and have decided to leave it up to mother nature. I know she will bless us with a bundle of joy soon. Thanks for always sharing your stories!</p>

I so loved being pregnant with everyone of them. I would love to have so many more. From the first moment I found out I was pregnant every time I was on cloud 9. I could stay pregnant everyday and never stop loving it. I am just like you I enjoyed having them move inside me it really amazed me. I know you are going to miss not having anymore but I makes up in some ways watching your kids grow and become aldults. I</p>
