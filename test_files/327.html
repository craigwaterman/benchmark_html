<h3><strong>Vintage cards<br></strong></h3>
<p>We buy all cards that are pre-1980.  Complete sets, partial sets, singles, graded or raw in all conditions, we have an interest in. </p>
Hall of Fame players, key rookie cards, and other highly notable players (Pete Rose, et al) are the cards that will be the most valuable.<br><br>
<h3><strong>Modern cards<br></strong></h3>
<p>For cards produced after 1980 we only look for key cards and cards from the latest new releases.  Unfortunately most common cards have been  overproduced and have not held much value since the mid-1970s.  We often do buy bulk of new releases, especially of rookie cards, relics and autographed cards.</p>

        </p>
    
        
          <p>﻿﻿We decided to give the Throwback Thursday post a try this week!  To make this one a quick read, we just jumped into the wayback machine and tried to find some old data on sportscards.  After a couple of minutes of browsing we came across this list from the summer of 2002:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Top Selling Sportscards eBay 2002" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/top_selling_cards_on_ebay_2002_large.jpg?15354102699971172070" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This list is from August 5th, 2002 featuring eBay's data on the best selling cards at the time.  It's no surprise that Alex Rodriguez's top selling rookie card, <a title="1994 SP 15 Alex Rodriguez" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=94SPalexrodriguez&amp;icep_uq=1994+SP+Alex+Rodriguez+15&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">the 1994 SP</a> made by Upper Deck is leading the way that summer.  He was in his second season as a Texas Ranger after signing one of the all time largest contracts in sports history.  He lead the American league with 57 homeruns and 142 RBI.  He would take home an AL MVP the following season.  He was seemingly a lock for the Hall of Fame already...then.  As you may know, this card has fallen considerably in value since then as collectors soured on him after constant headlines for the wrong reasons over the past decade. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's little surprise to see Vince Carter and Allen Iverson on the list after their epic battle in the 2001 NBA playoffs during the Eastern Conference Finals.  That is still one of the highest non-finals games of all time for television ratings.  <a title="1998 SP Authentic 95 Vince Carter" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=98spauthvincecarter&amp;icep_uq=1998+sp+authentic+95+vince+carter&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Vince Carter's 1998 SP Authentic</a> is still a fairly popular card.  <a title="1996 SP 141 Allen Iverson" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=96spalleniverson&amp;icep_uq=1996+sp+141+allen+iverson&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Allen Iverson's 1996 SP</a> is still a key for him.  Both of these have lost most of their value as both players lost collector interest over time, but maybe a Hall of Fame induction will spark an uptick in prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roger Clemens prices have fallen dramatically since then as well.  Time will tell what happens, but <a title="1985 Topps Roger Clemens" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsclemens&amp;icep_uq=1985+topps+roger+clemens&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">1985 Topps rookies</a> are easily found for very little money on eBay these days.  We recommend buying them graded as there are fakes and the graded ones, especially in 7 &amp; 8 level grades are still very inexpensive.  Mark McGwire is in a similar boat to Roger with his <a title="1985 Topps Mark McGwire" target="_blank" href="&lt;script&gt;document.write('&lt;a%20target=%22_self%22%20href=%22http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;icep_uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg%22&gt;http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;icep_uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img%20style=%22text-decoration:none;border:0;padding:0;margin:0;%22%20src=%22http://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;mpt='+Math.floor(Math.random()*999999999)+'%22&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a%20target=%22_self%22%20href=%22http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;icep_uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg%22&gt;http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;icep_uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img%20style=%22text-decoration:none;border:0;padding:0;margin:0;%22%20src=%22http://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=85toppsmcgwire&amp;uq=1985+topps+mark+mcgwire&amp;mpt=%5BCACHEBUSTER%5D%22&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;">1985 Topps USA Olympic rookie cards</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Michael Jordan's 1986 Fleer is generally in the top selling cards at all times.  It falls out of the top 10 here and there, but it always will be among the most desirable cards of any player.  Be very cautious buying these, we recommend these graded as well.  Centered examples tend to bring premiums in any grade.  If you can live with one being off center, you can score a real bargain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=89UDgriffey&amp;icep_uq=1989+upper+deck+griffey&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">The 1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr</a> is an iconic rookie card that also is usually always up on the best selling list.  It was the first card Upper Deck produced for their new landmark set which changed the landscape of sportscards forever.  Arguably the most popular modern card ever issued.  We do not think it can get as valuable as many vintage cards because so many were produced, but they will always have some value due to the popularity.  A blue chip card that most people want to own.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a title="1995 SP Terrell Davis" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=95spdavis&amp;icep_uq=1995+sp+terrell+davis&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">1995 SP Terrell Davis rookie card</a> was huge in the late 1990s.  He was as dominant a running back as the NFL has seen for a few seasons, but injuries took him down.  This card had fallen in value and if memory serves, these were largely selling as a rebound for flippers heading into the 2002 season.  Terrell never played again, so this flip did not work out.  For now these are very inexpensive and if the Hall of Fame calls for him, they certainly would see a spike.  Time will tell on his career as well, the downside being how short it was.  As the all-time leading rusher for the Denver Broncos and a Super Bowl champion, these will always have some value as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a title="1991 Topps Traded Jason Giambi" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=91TTGiambi&amp;icep_uq=1991+topps+traded+giambi&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">1991 Topps Traded Jason Giambi</a> was a big card in the summer of 2002.  He had moved to the New Yankees after a few dominant seasons in Oakland winning the 2000 AL MVP award.  He was key to helping the Yankees win a nother 2002 AL East title, leading the pinstripes with 41 Homeruns and 122 RBI.  These are probably not going to be worth much long term.  Collectors have little interest and with patience you can grab these for less than coffee and graded may run you several dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="1992 Bowman 532 Manny Ramirez" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1992_Bowman_Manny_large.jpg?1877715487788857877" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, the <a title="1992 Bowman Manny Ramirez rookie card" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=92bowmanmanny&amp;icep_uq=1992+bowman+manny+ramirez+532&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">1992 Bowman Manny Ramirez</a>.  Manny mania was still big in Boston during 2002.  Ramirez would get very hot in the summer of 2002 ending up winning the American League batting title for the only time in his career at .349.  He overcame injuries in May and June that left him with mediocre numbers mid-season.  He went on to hit 24 Homeruns with a .354 average in the second half.  These had cooled since 2001 when PSA 10s traded north of $500 each, but they have moved to the icebox now where you can grab these very inexpensively.  If he does not get into the Hall of Fame these will likely retain a small value in the future as he was such a character..."Manny being Manny"! as part of the storied 2004 Red Sox team.</p>
<h3><strong>#TBT</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's disappointing to see nothing from the NHL, but do remember our best sale that year was a <a title="2001 Upper Deck 211 Ilya Kovulchuk" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=2001kovulchuk&amp;icep_uq=2001+upper+deck+211+kovulchuk&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=12&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">2001 Upper Deck Young Guns Ilya Kovulchuk</a> PSA 10.  What a sharp card that was, will never forget it.  He was the first Russian player selected first overall in the NHL draft in 2001.  He had a great NHL career, but not as good as the hype he had back then, eventually walking away early to the KHL.  He was going to put the Thrashers on the map and win a few Stanley Cups with them.  The price has fallen dramatically on these, but they are still relatively scarce and sell for approximately $20 USD now. </p>

          <p><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>**EDIT - we do not recommend ordering from Collector Crate at this time** </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>It looks like Collector Crate has run into some trouble.  To see more on this, Sports Card Radio reported on it <a style="color: #cc0000;" title="Sportscard Radio Collector Crate update" target="_blank" href="http://www.sportscardradio.com/news/1824-do-not-order-from-collectorcrate-com">here</a> first.  Sports Card Info put together more on the story <a style="color: #cc0000;" title="Sportscard Into Collector Crate update" target="_blank" href="https://sportscardinfo.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/has-collectorcrate-gone-out-of-business/">here</a>.  We do not know anything definitive at this time, but a lack of response from Collector Crate is troubling at the very least.  It seemed like a promising idea that maybe another company will pick up from here, but for now we cannot recommend them as something to try out as we had wrote about below.</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We recently won a twitter contest for a <a title="Collector Crate - Homepage" target="_blank" href="http://www.collectorcrate.com/">Collector Crate</a>!  We had never won a social media contest of any kind before, so needless to say this is pretty exciting to start with a crate!  To quickly explain what these are, we will let their explanation do the talking:</p>

<h3><strong>So what's in the box?<br></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/crate_large.jpg?9193558041404364408"></strong></p>
<p>We received a silver level crate as the prize.  These are the $69.99 level boxes and we had some idea what to expect based on the description, but once we opened the lid, it was amazing the amount of stuff that was inside!   There is a detailed list on the Collector Crate homepage that identifies what comes with each level.  Bronze starts at $29.99 and the highest is the gold level at $99.99.  We will do our best to keep this post concise, while trying to use more pictures.</p>
<h3><strong>The Miscellaneous items<br></strong></h3>
<p>We decided to start with the non-traditional items that are not packs.  When we won, they asked what our favorite 3 teams were.  Those of you who know us, know the first team is the Red Sox and lucky for us there was a lot here (we also named the Giants and the Cubs).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/Pedroiafathead_large.jpg?6420213559312591369"></p>
<p> The first piece that grabbed us was a Pedroia fathead!  He is among my wife's favorite players, so this is an obvious keeper!  Look for him to rebound in 2015 as he looks healthy for the first time in years!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Red Sox sunglasses" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/RedSoxshades_medium.jpg?2601839508243825130" style="float: none;"> <img alt="Boston Red Sox Sticker" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/RedSoxsticker_medium.jpg?2601839508243825130" style="float: none;">     <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/RedSoxpennant_medium.jpg?2601839508243825130" height="130" width="262"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/Nomar3dstars_medium.jpg?6326015660702279592"></p>
<p>Then many more Red Sox themed items including, sunglasses (my son now own's them), a metallic sticker, a mini pennant and a pack of 3D stars featuring Nomar Garciaparra!  The pack revealed two Sammy Sosa variations, a Jason Giambi (NYY), and a Chipper Jones.</p>
<p>Next up was one of the massive 1984 Topps Super Size packs!  These cards are obviously giant!  Love the Carlton we pulled, but the centering is just a little off... vintage packs are often this way explaining why those old PSA 10s sell for big bucks!  Not sure who the "other" piece is yet...1st baseman is my initial guess?  The cut is strange enough to create an optical illusion that the card did not fit in the wrapper... but in reality it did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1984toppssupersize_medium.jpg?107008698116793711">            <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1984toppsstevecarltongiant_medium.jpg?107008698116793711"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far this is a fun product to break!  All kinds of goodies in the crate, especially related to our favorite team!  However, there is even more... From top left and downwards in first picture... The mini helmet is the San Francisco Giants, hoping to get to a game out there soon!  My son took the big league gumball very quickly!  There is a pack of doubleheaders...have not opened one of these in years...we pulled Jerome Walton, remember how hot that guy was in 1990?  My daughter immediately ran off with the fruit gushers pack.  The 4 MLB chipz we got featuring Danks, Axford, and Robinson Cano.  The mystery Red Sox chip is Jacoby Ellsbury.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/miscitems_large.jpg?3934467174496127321"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h3><strong>On to the traditional packs of cards!<br></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far this crate has had a lot of very nice items, but the traditional packs are the biggest part of the fun for collectors!  One pack jumped out at us right away, it was a pack of 1999 Skybox Molten Metal.  These were innovative at the time for Fleer and were a mid-range hobby only product.  The pack is oversized, but features standard size cards.  The cool thing about our pack here is it's a 20th National pack.  These were distributed only at the National in Atlanta that year.  Easy to identify with the NSCC logo on the lower right.  In case you are unfamiliar, the NSCC is the <a title="National Sports Collectors Convention - NSCC Homepage" target="_blank" href="http://nsccshow.com/">National Sports Collector's Convention</a>, the biggest annual show each year.  Often exclusive products are distributed at the convention, such as this pack we are about to open. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="1999 Skybox Molten Metal pack NSCC exclusive pack" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1999_Skybox_Molten_Metal_pack_large.jpg?17260232794969835378" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to the usual Metal Smiths and Heavy Metal cards, each special NSCC pack had one metal die cut card in a 30 card set of only Braves!  Hoping for a Hall of Famer, we scored a John Smoltz (bottom center)!  Our Heavy Metal is another Hall of Famer, Roberto Alomar with the Cleveland Indians at the time (top left)!  Todd Walker, Jason Giambi, Miguael Tejada, and Will the Thrill are solid players.  Fantastic pack!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/skyboxmoltenmetal_large.jpg?14622969014733323891"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the coolest packs in our crate was a pack or can of 1998 Pinnacle Inside!  These were released in can form, much like a standard soup can and you needed to open them with a can opener.  One in every 47 cans were gold parallel cans, but we got a regular version.  Each can has a different player or team.  We received an Arizona Diamondbacks can celebrating their inaugural season!  In every can when you open it, there is a pack of 10 cards sealed in plastic.  **A tip is to make sure you open the can from the bottom.**  These have value afterwards and many collect the cans.  The cans opened from the top have little value.  Our pack was great for the time as it included an Inside Tips Pitch Around card of Frank Thomas, Kevin Brown coming off a World Series win with a note of his trade to San Diego, Padres Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, a Miguel Tejada "rookie", a smiling Sammy Sosa, and a shortstop named Nomar Garciaparra who had just won rookie of the year in 1997.  Very tough to beat that kind of luck if you imagine opening the pack in 1998. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/pinnacle_large.jpg?1294947368461786651" style="float: none;"></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<p>We moved to another group of packs with that classic 1980s look and feel.  Plenty of superstars and Hall of Famers to chase so we were excited to see who may be revealed?   Top left we begin with featuring 1987 Fleer Star Stickers.  The sticker card is the Chicago Cubs.  Best pull here looks like an Eric Davis.  Following next is a 1981 Fleer Sticker and All star game pack which features various team stickers and all star game trivia.  The gum is very stuck to the Tigers sticker! </p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1980s_packs_medium.jpg?12272415431426661484" height="221" width="164"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1987fleerstickers_medium.jpg?36316237398479972" style="float: none;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1981fleerstarstickers_medium.jpg?16632510790939982009" height="221" width="243">
</div>
 
<p>1989 Donruss is next, actually a favorite of ours!  Will we see a Ken Griffey Jr rookie card?  We did hit a "Rated Rookie" but it was Carlos Quintana.  My sister was a fan of his back then and thought he was going to be a star player for the Red Sox... oh well.  Last pack was a 1983 Donruss Hall of Fame Heroes.  No trouble pulling some stars here!  Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron included!</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/carlosquintana_medium.jpg?940501973892736351"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1983donrussHOF1_medium.jpg?13917767423163037589"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1983donrussHOF2_medium.jpg?6360809378292982331"></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>More packs!</strong></h3>
<p>The crate continues with more packs.  The next group of packs covers a range of 14 seasons.  More chances to pull some key cards in this group and we will open them backwards this time from lower right up to top left.  So the order is 2000 Skybox Molten Metal, 2007 Bowman's Best, 1984 Topps, and finally a 1993 Bowman pack.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_6.26.58_PM_large.png?3626198571183878527"></p>
<p>Starting with the 2000 Molten Metal we got some nice cards and hit an Emerald of Roger Cedeno, which fell one in every four packs then.  Anyone win a fantasy league back then without that guy around to lead your team to a steals category win?  The 2007 Bowman's Best was an excellent pack.  Chipper Jones and Alex Rodriguez on the top row.  A rookie autograph of Adam Ottavino, now in the Rockies pen, and the bottom row is an Ichiro and a Ken Griffey Jr.  If you know these cards they are a nice design and hard to take photos from the refracting.  1984 Topps is another favorite of ours.  The gum is stuck to a Larry Williams and of note we pulled a stunning Ripken.  If graded, it's a 9 or 10 level card if it had better centering.  A real pack fresh beauty.  Lastly, a pack of 1993 Bowman.  A Jeter maybe?  No luck today, but notable cards included a Foil parallel of Red Sox super prospect Frankie Rodriguez (he was going to win many Cy Youngs awards) and the card of an up and coming Bernie Williams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2000skyboxmolten_large.jpg?3934467174496127321" style="float: none;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2007bowmansbest_large.jpg?3934467174496127321">     <img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1984topps_large.jpg?4854102866784653255" style="float: none;">   <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1993bowmanpack_large.jpg?56387947115221951"></p>
<h3><strong>More packs...yes seriously!</strong></h3>
<p>In the next group there is a very cool 1997 Donruss Preferred tin pack! The others are packs of 2013 Topps Chrome, 2015 Donruss, and 2001 Upper Deck Decade 1970s baseball.  So this groups spans another 18 seasons, plenty of chances for stars!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/morepacks_large.jpg?4185035537147069714"></p>
<p>We will start with the 2013 Topps Chrome, it's actually 3 packs together with the orange refractor pack bonus. The best three cards of the regular packs included a Jackie Bradley Jr rookie card, an Oswaldo Arcia xfractor rookie card and a 1972 look Miguel Cabrera.  The orange pack is where these really impress.  In that 3 card pack was a Nick Franklin rookie card, a Dustin Pedroia, and a Mike Trout! </p>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2013toppschrome_medium.jpg?6113156078528569" height="137" width="281"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2013chromeorange_medium.jpg?4185035537147069714" height="206" width="237">
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<p>2015 Donruss is a recent release and this one had many nice cards as well including a Clayton Kershaw, a Francisco Lindor Elite insert (he looks like a future star), and a Justin Garza Olympic card.  Not a bad design this year and it looks like a challenging set to build still. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2015donruss_medium.jpg?3028912975052457492" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2001 UD Decade 1970s featured psychedelic cards of Ruppert Jones, Dale Murphy, Lou Brock, Dave Parker, and Joe Morgan.  Lots of star power combined with a very classic 70s look is a winner!  Finally, the tin had a nice group, highlighted by a silver parallel of Edgar Martinez.  Edgar needs more of a look for the Hall of Fame, so be it if he was a DH.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2001UDdecade70s_medium.jpg?3028912975052457492" style="float: none;"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1997preferred_medium.jpg?3934467174496127321"></p>
<h3><strong>The best for last<br></strong></h3>
<p>So we have made it to the last few items now.  The first is a pack of 1999 Topps Stars and Steel.  These are oversized packs that open like a tri-fold booklet and feature steel cards made using what is termed "serilusion technology" where a film laminate is bonded to an actual piece of 25 gauge metal.  Only in the 1990s did the collectibles industry see such unusual card designs.  Each "pack" features three cards and there were Gold and Domed holographic parallels randomly inserted at 1 in 12 and 1 in 24 pack rates. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1999toppssteelpack_large.jpg?17221998792697978210" style="float: none;"></p>
<p>We hit 3 nice base cards featuring Andres Galarraga, Tony Clark, and Hall of Famer, Tony Gwynn.  Tony Gwynn is one of those players who really should be recognized more for his hitting abilities than he is.  He had such a quietly consistent career like few players to play any sport.  Besides his shortened rookie year, he hit .300 or better every single year he played... into his 40s. Every single year.  Consistent, period.  He got to the postseason three times and hit .306.  He played in two World Series and hit .371.  Amazing hitter.  Mr. Padre is missed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/1999toppssteelandstars_large.jpg?4679174669219976637"></p>
<h3><strong>The grand finale - the hit pack that has the guaranteed autos and relics!</strong></h3>
<p>We think it's a solid idea to add some guaranteed hits to the Collector Crate to make sure everyone gets something really exciting.  We had plenty of great items as it is, but just in case the packs don't yield enough these are awesome!  It comes in a black zip-lock style bag so that you don't know what will be inside.  We were hoping it would have something to do with our teams choices in the beginning and we were pleasantly rewarded that way.  At this level the promise is two game used items and two autographs and a rookie card, but there was more included.  For the Giants fan in us we love the 1986 Topps Traded Barry Bonds rookie card.  The first autograph is an Adam Lind numbered to 399 made.  The other autograph was a Cesar Puello from 2014 Bowman Chrome.  He has a nice combination of power and speed that may make the majors soon as he is up to AAA.  As Red Sox fans first the game used cards are Jon Lester numbered to 399 made from 2013 Tier One and a green 2015 Donruss relic of David Ortiz!  Additionally we received a Collector Crate card exclusive sketch print of Red Sox legend, Ted Williams!  Emily Tester is the master of this artwork and she did an awesome job on this one!  The last item is a porcelain example of Hall of Famer, Joe Kelley's T206 Old Mill card with a Piedmont back.  Joe was born in Cambridge, MA and made his debut with the Boston Beaneaters.  Only 1909 of these sets were produced, very cool card.   Here is a shot of all of these hits:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Collector Crate - Hits" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/cratehits_large.jpg?12080627233242678255" style="float: none;"></p>
<h3><strong>In Summary</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">We took our time opening this, enjoying every minute of it!  The team at <a title="Collector Crate - Homepage" target="_blank" href="http://www.collectorcrate.com/">Collector Crate</a> obviously does a nice job packing in a lot of variety.  As you can see the packs will cover many different time periods and the miscellaneous items are excellent additions to a crate.  Any sports fan would be more than happy to receive one of these as a gift or on a regular basis.  The only caveat we can think of is that a seasoned collector may not enjoy this as much, as they may want to purchase their own packs.  Different collectors often have very different tastes (an 80s collector may not like recent packs and vice versa).  We enjoy many different aspects of collecting so a product like this is a winner to us.  If you are looking for a gift for a collector or you are new to collecting, we cannot think of an easier way to get into collecting.  You will get exposure to numerous areas of collecting with a Collector Crate and you can go from there when you learn what you like most.</p>

        </p>
    
        
          <p>So it's that time of year where an annual baseball card collector favorite, Topps Heritage baseball has just been released.  We are already seeing some awesome pulls on social media and the popular online venues where cards are sold!  A few red "Real One" autographs numbered out of 66, punchboard boxtoppers, down to very cool "gum stained" cards are all selling for strong prices so far.  You just never know what you will get in a box of this set, which makes it so much fun to open.  For fun in this post, we decided to share our best pull from Heritage over the years that we ever hit...a "white whale" card. </p>
<h3><strong>More on "White whale" cards<br></strong></h3>
<p>What do we consider "white whale" cards?  Honestly the term is thrown around a little too often sometimes on cards that are cool, but not truly outstanding enough to be a real "white whale" in our minds.  To each his own, but we reserve the term for cards that fall into a few buckets.  One bucket are cards that are truly scarce now because of a low amount of survivors.  Think of pre-war cards made in the 19th century where less than a handful are known to exist.  Those are cards that when you land one it's an incredible feeling and they tend to be very valuable in all conditions even if they are barely resembling cardboard anymore.</p>
<p>The next bucket we use the term for are condition rarities.  Many vintage sets in the post-war period from the 1950s to the 1980s have cards like this.  They are cards where although you may easily find an off grade to mid-grade card, finding one in mint to gem mint condition is exceptionally rare.  For some of these, just finding one centered can be a bear of a task in any grade.  These usually end up being quite valuable as well and there a few modern cards in this bucket as well.</p>
<p>The last bucket is where our pull lands.  We use the term here for modern cards that are close to impossible to find.  We reserve the term largely for key "1 of 1" cards where there is only one example out there.  As one of one's are more common now, we only apply it to key rookie cards and important relics and cut autographs.  In some cases, as was the case with our card, the manufacturer skips any significant marketing around these cards or even add them to released checklists.</p>
<h3><strong>A whale is sighted...<br></strong></h3>
<p>We always break some Heritage each year and the set has evolved with different distribution methods over the years as you may know.  In the fall of 2009, it was another year of the "Updates &amp; Highlights" boxes.  This is where high number Heritage cards were mixed with flagship update cards in packs rather than the complete set model you see today.  It was noted that there would be a run of cut signature cards, but we have never found a complete list to this day for 2009.  These cards are so tough to pull in these sets, that we typically do not have them on our radar as something to pull, because it just doesn't happen. </p>
<p>My wife and I always break boxes together.  I had not planned on breaking many boxes of the high numbers in 2009, but we usually buy at least a little of every Heritage set.  The economy was still on shaky ground and it was a tough year overall selling singles.  We waited to see what the holidays looked like and saved more money for our kids instead.  Ironically, my in-laws who usually get us cards for Christmas chose a single hobby box of 2009 Update and High Numbers as a gift.  It was a busy year with the kids and we got to opening it that night.  </p>
<p>We always have a good time opening Heritage.  I tend to sit and read each card as I go because I enjoy this set in an old-fashioned way compared to most other sets.  We usually split the packs in half and go at our own pace.  My wife grabbed a pack from the box and said this one feels like winner.  I get that often from her, so I didn't flinch as I was reading the back of a Pedroia base card thinking it could be an SSP.  I thought I had scored, but I would soon be outdone.  As she opened the pack she had that face when she hits something extra special (she knows when she hits something valuable).  "I got a really thick card with an auto and a jersey!"  While she enjoys baseball very much, she doesn't know her history as well as I do and asks me... "Is Roger Maris a good player?... I think this may be a pretty big card".   "It's a real 1/1!!!", she yelled grinning indicating I need to pay attention now.  As I leaned to take a closer look...</p>
<p>Here is what she landed that night....</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2009marisfront_large.jpg?13902548741371317381"></p>
<p>I feel like we jumped up and down for an hour and then told the story over and over at shows and online for weeks.  It was one of the highly coveted and under publicized Cut Autograph Relic cards from 2009's set, featuring Roger Maris!  A true 1 of 1 card of a lifetime!  A genuine "white whale" of a pull for us, especially considering the significance of this card!  As you may know the 2009 set was based on the 1960 Topps design.  That year Maris would have an outstanding season after being traded to the Yankees, showing some of the power that he would go on to display in 1961 to break a well known record we all know.  He lead the league with 112 runs batted in, a .581 slugging percentage, took home a Gold Glove award, and was ultimately the American League MVP in 1960.  Most people we meet have still never heard of it, so it definitely fits the bill for a "white whale" to us.</p>
<p> <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/2009marisback_large.jpg?16096501164378020121" width="472" height="352"></p>
<p>This card is likely always going to be our very best pull from a Heritage pack!  Although my wife would not agree as a diehard Red Sox fan, I still consider it the best pull we ever had out of any product due to it's "white whale" nature.  The Yankee pinstripe was a nice added touch on the relic and the "cut" fit inside the window which sometimes doesn't happen.  The card, although fresh from a new pack, had a real "vintage feel" about it.  It was a great design by Topps that I wonder why they did not advertise more as a possible "chase card".  I did enjoy the card for a little while and then decided to sell.  I wanted to find a collector who would appreciate the Yankee history more.  I fielded numerous offers at the time, but felt the economy was too soft and the offers were too low.  We put it away in a display case for awhile. </p>
<p>We ended up selling the card a couple of years later on eBay for significantly more money than we had been offered at the time.  We are proud to say that it easily topped the "<a title="Top 50 Most Wacthed Sports Card Auctions on eBay" target="_blank" href="http://www.cardboardconnection.com/top-50-most-watched-ebay-sports-card-auction-tracker">Top 50 Most Watched Sports Cards on eBay</a>" hosted by Cardboard Connection when we sold it.  The buyer was a high end collector that we shall not name for privacy.  I do not know where the card has traveled to since, but I would guess that buyer still owns it if I had to.  Just an exceptional card!</p>
<h3><strong>Best of luck with your Topps Heritage breaks this year and beyond!</strong></h3>
<p>We hope this post shows you how magic can happen when you open a box of sportscards.  When it does, we doubt you will ever forget the feeling! </p>

          <h3><strong>The concept of "you pick" lots<br></strong></h3>
<p>We were recently<strong></strong> asked about the "you pick" lots you see on eBay and similar venues by someone who had never heard of them before.  At times, they go by various names and slang such as "U choose" or "you pick 'em" among others.  While we are not certain when they first began online, by the mid-2000s these pick lots had become very popular and still are today.  For newer collectors or collectors that have been away from the hobby for a long time, there can be confusion and misunderstanding with these lots.  This post should quickly alleviate any confusion for you and actually give you a great way to get a lot more out of your collection with significantly less effort.</p>
<p>It's the most efficient way to complete sets of all different kinds in today's market.  We have seen it with all kinds of trading card sets from baseball cards to obscure non-sport sets.  The primary purpose of these lots is to help collectors finish sets as easily as possible and typically as cost effective as possible.  This is especially true if you have no local card shows or retailers that carry singles for set builders.  Pick lots came about to take advantage of the ease of the internet.  The way to find them if you have never heard of them yet is to get onto an online venue that facilitates them.  It's most often eBay or other smaller venues that are similar where sellers can control the listings they make.  The search is easy... enter the set and the words "you pick" or "you choose" with them.  You could use "2010 Topps you pick" if you are working on a 2010 Topps set.  A random search using only "you pick" gives us results like you see below.  As you can see, anything from vintage sets to specific subsets and parallels of recent releases can be found in the "you pick" format.  You can mix and match for hundreds of sets on eBay now.<strong></strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0625/4961/files/upickscreen_grande.jpg?9051548789144929119"></strong></h3>
<br>
<p>Each pick lot has a few elements to be aware of which are what set or subset is featured, how many cards are included and any special conditions different sellers may have.  That will be clear in the description for you.  We can take the last example above and note that you would receive 10 near mint out of the pack cards from 1975 Topps.  Where pick lots illustrate their efficiency is that the buyer will literally pick exactly which 10 cards they are buying.  Each seller's listing will have a different list of the available cards and the buyer will get to select from that list.  Then for a flat price regardless of card, the buyer receives the ten they picked.  In this example it's $1.20 per card regardless of which card.<br><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Benefits to collectors</strong></h3>
<p>Often, when down to the last few cards, it makes a lot of sense to simply search for the cards you need and buy them until you have finished your set.  However, if you need 25 cards, paying for each card through many different sellers can waste a lot of time and money if a buyer is not careful.  Pick lots can get you the final 10, 20 or more cards in one single purchase... saving you the time and often the money.  You can also use them in different ways, such as to get all the cards of a certain team, or to acquire all the cards of a certain player or character.</p>
<p>In most pick lots, the singles are usually less expensive because the seller does not have to spend as much time listing an example of 143 commons they have.  They can make a single listing at a fixed price and let a collector get what they need quickly.  It's frequently a win for both the buyer and seller in pick lots.  In many cases sellers can make custom lots as well if you contact them... what if you need 17 cards, but lots are only in 10 or 20... you can ask for a custom lot of 17 to make things much easier for you.  It can be a great way to fill some moderately challenging and large sets quickly.  Many sellers will also cut the price per card as you make the lots larger to save even more.</p>
<h3><strong>Advanced benefits<br></strong></h3>
<p>If you like to sell sportscards, some pick lots can also be great money makers.  Many insert and special card sets are done in pick lot formats in today's collectibles market.  If you know singles from a set sell for $3 each frequently and you find a 10 card pick lot for $5 you can see the quick math.  10 cards sold at the $3 going rate brings you $30 for every $5 you spend through the pick lots.  We have seen this work well with prospect and rookie laden sets over the years as well.  Grab the likely hot rookie for a quarter each in pick lots and sell them as groups for solid gains.  Others know you can find rare cards and stars buried in these lots, too.  It varies by sets and you should do your homework to take advantage of pick lots in this way.  We know many collectors who do this every week to fund purchases of more cards for themselves.</p>
<h3><strong>Hope this helps you!</strong></h3>
We do run pick lots in our <strong><a title="Collect The Hobby eBay Store" target="_blank" href="http://stores.ebay.com/CollectTheHobby">eBay store</a></strong> fairly frequently (search "pick") and there are always hundreds of <strong><a title="eBay pick lots sportscards sets" target="_blank" href="http://ebay.to/1zyrH2d">other sets on eBay</a></strong> every day as well.<br><br>
<p>We hope this post gives you a good general idea of what pick lots are for trading cards and how they can help you improve your collection.  If you ever need help with your sportscards collection, feel free to <a href="http://www.collectthehobby.com/pages/about-us">contact us</a>.  We would also welcome some comments below if you have any other questions or thoughts on this post.  For more general information, like us on <a title="Collect The Hobby - Facebook" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/collectthehobby">facebook</a>, follow us on <a title="Collect The Hobby - twitter" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/CollectTheHobby">twitter</a>, <a title="Collect The Hobby - Instagram" target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/collectthehobby/">instagram</a>, or <a title="Collect The Hobby - Pinterest" target="_blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/CollectTheHobby/">pinterest</a>!</p>

          <h3><strong>Sportscard valuation in the 21st century</strong></h3>
<p>We often get questions and comments around the pricing of sportscards in the current market.  It certainly can be very confusing at times these days. Most cards used to exclusively follow the prices guides or “book values”, today that is often not the case. Why do some sell for huge amounts and others sell for almost nothing? What impacts values today? What are my cards worth? How can I figure out a fair price for my collection? Are baseball cards or football cards worth more?  If you have these types of questions read on…</p>
<p>Our goal is to help put our experiences out there regarding valuation and pricing in today’s market. If you are new to collecting or haven’t been collecting for a long time, this blog post should be especially helpful to you to get a general sense.</p>
<h3><strong>Historically speaking</strong></h3>
<p>We aren’t going to cover all the details for this post, but you should have a general history as it does impact today’s values. Here we are 15% of the way through the 21st century and sportscard valuation today has been most significantly impacted by a bubble and technology in the past quarter of a century. It’s been 25 years. As you may know the height of sportscard collecting popularity was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Sportscards first appeared in the late 19th century and have been collected since then to the present day. It was largely a simple hobby, mainly for children for decades until the 1970s. In the late 1970s many who collected started to make things more formal, documenting more and more sets, inviting more to collectors to catch the bug.</p>
<p>As the hobby began to mature and get more organized in the late 1970s and early 1980s more formal card shows, hobby stores, and manufacturers continued to appear. Subsequently more and more people began collecting cards than ever before. Nothing seemed to change the industry more overall at the time than the emergence of a price guide and hobby publication called Beckett Monthly. There were several price guides at the time, especially by the late 1980s, but Beckett was always the leader in our area, so most dealers and subsequently collectors bought, sold, and traded cards based on these values. The “book value” was synonymous with Beckett price guides.</p>
<p>Once values began to have more importance to everyone beyond collecting, a wave of “investors” flooded the hobby. Passing over the details, financial publications touted sportscards as viable investments for all. A very long story short, it became a bubble like many “investments” do. The hobby had turned into much more than a hobby for thousands of people by the late 1980s. Consequently, sportscards were produced in incredible numbers between 1987 and 1994. Some of the mainstream sets are still available by the case for very short money today. Even some of the sports most prominent superstars sell for very little today and were a bust as an “investment”.  </p>
<p>As baseball cards continued to be the lion’s share of the sportscard market, a major problem arose in 1994, the ugly baseball strike occurred. As with any bubble, events like this provide the spark for the crash, and everyone runs for the exits. The industry suffered tremendous losses after the strike. Large discounts to “book value” became popular for the first time. Values began to sink quickly, although some key vintage cards held up well considering. For many the mid-1990s was the end of their involvement with sportscards. Collectors who genuinely loved it, continued on, but the pure investors who had no interest left. A good portion of dealers survived, but the majority folded during the mid-1990s. Values plummeted for almost everything for a while. By 1998 the infamous McGwire and Sosa homerun chase brought some interest back, but it is unlikely to ever reach that level of popularity again. By the late 1990s technology started making its impact.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology changes the playing field</strong></h3>
<p>In 1995 with all kinds of new internet based sites being launched in the early days of another crash known as the dot-com bubble, an idea to create a platform for anyone to buy and sell from anyone else emerged into eBay. Even though there were many established ways to buy and sell cards, by the late 1990s eBay was really embraced by collectors. Collectors were suddenly given a 24/7 sportscard shop that would allow them easy access to cards all over the world.   Even more importantly, collectors could quickly sell their own sportscards and no longer needed a dealer to sell them. These changes, along with numerous other websites, changed the industry forever.</p>
<p>The supply and demand curves were completely upended and redrawn. Suddenly a card you used to call 4 local shops looking for to no avail was available all day online. You didn’t need to rummage bins looking for a couple singles at a show to complete your sets. You could just get on eBay and order them that day.   Some of the most valuable cards in the mid-1990s were serial numbered. A lower production such as 5,000 made them tougher to locate at your local store. Prior to eBay these cards had more demand than supply locally. The value changed really quickly as you may guess however, if suddenly there was 140 of them on eBay to choose from.   Now the supply was getting larger than the demand overall.  </p>
<p>The impact as you may expect, carried into sportscards throughout. Once you had a real challenge to find all the high numbers to many of the classic 1950s and 1960s Topps sets. You might do ok at a large regional show, but at your local show and sportscard outlet, it was very challenging to find some of these cards at times. When eBay got rolling in the late 1990s, these cards in low to mid-grades plummeted in price as they became so easy to locate anytime you wanted. Mass produced rookie cards of the late 1980s and early 1990s also collapsed in price. You can purchase Hall of Famers and likely future Hall of Famers today for a lot less than you could in 1989. Many sportscards worth hundreds back then can be had for less than $5 now. The “crash” was slow for some who ignored the Internet in the early years. In 2001 you could still find a shop charging old-fashioned values based on a “book value”, but today you cannot ignore how technology has permanently changed valuation.</p>
<h3><strong>Market size and product changes</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above the height of the crazy days in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “investors” drove prices up at unrealistic rates, creating the bubble. The overall market was at its peak in those years. Part of why the sportscard industry is smaller today is because of these price gains… they carried into new products being released. By the early 1990s, leading with the famous 1989 Upper Deck set, packs moved into the $1 and up range. Prior to that new releases were inexpensive and targeted to children. Older packs began to become more expensive as investors continued to speculate.</p>
<p>As prices increased it swung to being more like the adult hobby it is today. By the late 1990s, children could no longer afford to join in for the most part. Manufacturers did try to make some lower cost products, but when the industry is focused on valuation, those sets couldn’t compete.   The most basic sets today will set you back several dollars per pack. That seems ok, but like many hobbies people will seek the “best” and those packs don’t usually feature the in demand cards in today’s industry.</p>
<p>Today’s industry features many products that are in the $100s per pack on release and that has frustrated many enough to move on.   Many of these products focus on people who love to gamble by providing chances to locate cards that may be worth thousands right out of the pack. It’s become more like the lottery. This situation also impacts values on all cards today, regardless of their original price point. With the global economy of recent years, many of these highly desirable products were out of many budgets. That has given way to the latest industry trend of “breaking” in case breaks and group breaks. This allows collectors to pool their money to break the more expensive products and get a chance at acquiring these expensive singles.  Breaking probably deserves another post explaining the mechanics, but for now it has to be mentioned as it has significant impact on the valuations of sportscards.</p>
<p>The other significant innovation has been sportscard grading. Several companies offer grading services today that will both authenticate your sportscards and rate them on a scale, assigning a number describing its condition. Once a card is graded it will be sealed in a tamper evident case to preserve the condition for years to come. You can easily see how a card rated a 7 is much nicer than a card with a grade of 2 when you have them side-by-side. Subsequently a 7 will sell for a lot more than a 2 of the same card. The older the set is, the more grades have skewed lower over the years.   With modern cards, many more have been well preserved compared to cards than are more than 50 years old. There are three established leaders in grading trading cards including <a title="PSA - homepage" target="_blank" href="http://www.psacard.com/">PSA</a>, <a title="Beckett Grading - homepage" target="_blank" href="http://www.beckett.com/grading/">BGS</a>, and <a title="SGC - homepage" target="_blank" href="http://sgccard.com/">SGC</a>. They are the most trusted for valuation purposes when sold. Numerous other grading companies exist, but they still do not see the same pricing premium as the big three.</p>
<p>Grading has had a tremendous impact on sportscard values as well. It has driven down values of off grade cards by bringing to light how common some can be, but the opposite has been true for high grade cards. The values of high grade cards are increased. This is especially in situations where a given card in a high grade is very challenging to locate. The impact of grading has also spread into modern cards as collectors seek to buy the nicest card they can find. It has really been felt in the world of complete set building. In many sets now you will at times see common cards outsell historically more expensive and more popular players. That is especially true in the top grades of historically condition sensitive cards.</p>
<h3><strong>So given that brief history, what determines value today?</strong></h3>
<p>In today's market there are several variables to consider that will impact the value of sportscards.  Here is a good list of the main ones and their typical impact to values.  There are always exception, but these are they keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>Condition</strong></em> – this variable typically supersedes all else on most trading cards. Much like many other areas like classic cars, vintage instruments, or other fine art, the condition is a huge factor in value. Items with a certified rating of condition typically sell very well, and values exponentially rise as the condition gets better. Generally, buyers will pay more for better condition items if they have the option with more easily found items.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Scarcity</strong></em> – the rarity of a card is plays an important role and at times can trump condition if the rarity is extreme enough. When a sportscard is rare based on known examples historically or in today’s market limited production (commonly serial numbered), condition plays less of a role because the buyer is more flexible when it’s tough to locate. Mass produced cards tend to lose value for the most part, unless the player is exceptional.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Licensing</strong></em> – there have been numerous examples of black market and/or unlicensed sets that have been produced over the years. These usually hold a lot less value to buyers. Officially licensed sets tend to be more mainstream in distribution and acceptance. In today’s trading card markets some sets have some licenses, but not all and those are typically worth less than similar cards that are officially licensed.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Performance/Market</strong></em> – In current sportscards, recent performance is a big variable. Popularity can drive prices up quickly. In sports a player can break some records or have a stellar season and his values will tend to rise. On the other hand a bust season or series of poor play can crash values of newer cards. Vintage cards tend to have a more steady pricing trend and over the long run it has been increasing, especially with regards to very popular, rare, or higher grade condition.  The local market can determine valuations. Many great players in smaller markets will sell for less than bench player or prospects in the bigger markets. Some franchises in every sport have massive followings and their cards tend to have higher values for comparable players to smaller markets. The markets with large following have more stable pricing overall than smaller markets.  Basketball cards have the largest international audience and hockey cards are strongest in Canada.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Set</strong></em> – The price point of boxes and packs will influence prices and that typically varies from set to set. Singles from more expensive products tend to sell for more both because sellers will ask for more and buyers will be expecting to pay more for higher end sets. The sets with packs in the hundreds as we mentioned earlier, will be the cards that bring the biggest premiums when selling.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Attributes</strong></em> – Cards in today’s market can come out of packs autographed or feature game used memorabilia. Those cards will sell for more than traditional cards that do not feature those attributes. Refractors came to the market in 1993 and have become very popular. Today the refractors will come in colors as well. Many cards may be serial numbered to a certain print run.   The lower the run, the higher the value tends to be as that increases rarity in the market.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Final notes to value your cards</strong></h3>
<p>So given a little history and the main variables impacting values today, what steps do you need to take to value your cards? It’s not a black and white science anymore where you just find your card in a price guide and go with that value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>Identification</strong></em> – you need to know what cards you have. The common questions are: What player is it, what year were they made, who manufactured it, what set are they from? Most sets feature numerical order, card 1, card 2, card 3 and so on where each card is a different player or event or picture in a set. This is where price guides will still give you the most help such a Beckett monthly. They are great as checklists to help you identify what cards you have. In most sets the last year of stats on the reverse of the card are looking at the prior season. If it ends with 1982, it’s typically going to be a set from 1983. If it is 2001, it’s likely a 2002 card and so on. Many sets will have the year on them somewhere as well, on the front or the back, or both. Once you figure out which card(s) you have, you can value them.  The Standard Catalogs for each sport are the most comprehensive you can use as checklists.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Actual sales</strong></em> – while there are some still going with the “book values” we have discussed, most buyers and sellers today use actual sales history. This is typically using the popular venues like eBay or an auction houses and analyzing the ending sales prices on their previously sold cards. If you learn you have a 1975 (year) Topps (set) George Brett (player) you can use that data to value it roughly with eBay for example. If you search the closed auctions for prices and try to match the condition as best as you can, you can get a general idea of the actual value.  </li>
<li>
<em><strong>Lastly</strong></em> - If you have a feeling that you may have some cards with a value in the hundreds or more, it makes a lot of sense to have a knowledgeable dealer or collector take another look at identification and assist you with condition if possible. This is highly recommended for a novice. It’s fairly painless now to take a few pictures with your smartphone and email them to someone who can help. You can easily attend a regional card show or visit your local hobby store with your cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are some of the hottest products in the collectibles market now?</strong></p>
<p>We know some areas have been red hot for awhile.  Anything Mike Trout or Clayton Kershaw is way up in 2014.  Garbage Pail Kids continue to be a popular area of collecting.  Vintage sportscards, especially pre-1960 in higher grades has continued its meteoric rise over the past 5 years.  How about new things to watch and possibly things you haven't considered yet this year?</p>
<p>One you may not have heard of yet are <a title="OYO Sports homepage" target="_blank" href="http://www.oyosports.com/">OYO sports</a> collectible figures.  These "dudes" have been gaining quickly in popularity in the past 12 months.  They have been released in series.  Right now they are licensed for the NFL, MLB, and the NHL.  Many of the best players and teams have figures already.  They hope to have an NBA deal in place soon.  A quick and easy way to get them is from reputable sellers on eBay.  Some of the series 1 <a title="OYO 1st series sets" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=oyosets&amp;icep_uq=oyo+1st+series+set&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">sets</a> and <a title="OYO 1st series figures" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=oyofigures&amp;icep_uq=oyo+1st+series+figure&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">figures</a> are already creeping up in value now.  The hottest release of the season are definitely the new <a title="OYO goalie figures" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=oyogoalie&amp;icep_uq=oyo+goalie&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">NHL goalie</a> "dudes".</p>
<p>For trading cards there are plenty of new sportscards sets coming out in December including Bowman Draft baseball, Topps Chrome football, Panini Prizm basketball and Upper Deck Black Diamond hockey to name some of our favorites.  However we think the coolest new product will be a non-sport product from Topps, Doctor Who trading cards.  You can find and take a look at some on <a title="Topps Doctor Who trading cards" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=toppsdoctorwho&amp;icep_uq=topps+doctor+who&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">eBay</a>.  There will be Blue, Red and gold parallels with printing plates.  Insert sets include Memorable Moments, Companions, The Doctor is in, TARDIS Travel, and Stitch in Time sets.  There will be autographs, dual autographs and cut autographs in this one!  And lastly... a variety of relic cards of pieces used or worn on the show.  Boxes have 24 packs in them with 8 cards per pack, making us think this will be a solid value!</p>
<p>In video games for younger players its looking like Skylanders has one more run in them with the new Trap Team <a title="Skylanders Trap Team Starter Packs" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=skylanderstrapstart&amp;icep_uq=skylanders+trap+team+starter&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">starter packs</a> and related <a title="Skylanders Trap Team figures" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=skylanderstrapfigure&amp;icep_uq=skylanders+trap+team+figure&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">figures</a> being released.  Elementary and up to middle school students, both boys and girls love this series still.  The best of the collectibles are the first series figures that are more challenging.  The Darklight Crypt with Ghost Roaster continues to sell for huge premiums over what they were in stores.  Try and find some of these lately?  Very scarce still.  Another title sure to do really well with its following is <a title="Super Smash Bros" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=supersmashbros&amp;icep_uq=super+smash+bros+wiiu&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Super Smash Bros on WiiU</a>!  The latest is there will be Amiibo NFC-enabled characters that you can use with the WiiU controller to insert your favorite guys into the game!  The figures will have two way data streams back and forth to save!  Kids can't get enough of this! </p>
<p>For older gamers, <a title="Call of Duty Advanced Warfare" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=CODadvwarefare&amp;icep_uq=call+of+duty+advanced+warfare&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Call of Duty Advanced Warfare</a> on all systems will be very hot this year!  New graphics engines, new exo-suit and it's Call of Duty?  Best selling game of the year candidate again!  A new installment, <a title="Assassin's Creed Unity" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=Acreedunity&amp;icep_uq=assassins+creed+unity&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Assassin's Creed - Unity</a> is part of the mix.  More new graphics and a fan favorite should be popular as always.  There is a new World of Warcraft expansion coming.  Perhaps the most engulfing thing for 2014 will be a new Dragon Age installment called <a title="Dragon Age: Inquisition" target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&amp;pub=5575103742&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337590660&amp;customid=dragonage&amp;icep_uq=dragon+age+inquisition&amp;icep_sellerId=&amp;icep_ex_kw=&amp;icep_sortBy=1&amp;icep_catId=&amp;icep_minPrice=&amp;icep_maxPrice=&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.  This one is supposed to have roughly 50 hours of main gameplay and approximately 100 hours of sidequests!  This one will take a lot of time to tackle, you were warned!  Will any of these games in unopened condition be very valuable in 25 years?  Will be fun to watch.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>Feel free to comment with your thoughts on what collectibles you will be looking for this year!   Happy Holidays to everyone in 2014 and beyond!<strong></strong></p>
