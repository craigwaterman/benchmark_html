Or have you ever seen someone wearing the coolest outfit ever, save for their shoelaces? Then you share my exasperation about the current state of the fashion world. True enough; the industry seems to be paying as little attention as possible when it comes to shoelaces. It’s as if the fashion experts already expect everyone to know which shoelaces to wear for which shoes. However, that clearly is not the case. Very few people have extensive knowledge [&hellip;]</p>

Some bloggers even went as far as to declare neon as “the new black.” And true enough, neon shades are very attractive and eye-catching. However, the danger is that they could also be overwhelming at times especially when worn in large volumes. This is the reason why neon clothes, especially neon yellow pieces, are not the best of choices when it comes to formal events or night events in general. Neon can be worn in large volumes in the daylight, but definitely not in the office setting [&hellip;]</p>

As with almost anything, there are pros and cons to each one, and it all boils down to a person’s personal preference. And over the years of my collecting shoelaces, I have grown a special fondness for leather shoelaces. Some friends of mine do not like them that much because apparently, they can get undone more easily than shoelaces made up of other raw materials. I’ve never had problems regarding this, so I pretty much ignore their rants and [&hellip;]</p>

That word is ‘character.’ Sure, Pinterest and Tumblr fashion blogs could help you big time, but there is nothing more satisfying than being able to say that your look is entirely ‘yours.’ Your whole outfit should have its own ‘character,’ for only with strong fashion character can you truly are a trendsetter. Now, I understand why it must be hard to put up an altogether unique look nowadays, since fashion blogs are everywhere, but there is one piece of clothing that [&hellip;]</p>

To add to that, I cannot remember ever seeing a decent pair of shoes that has yellow laces on them. Most shoe manufacturers offer their new pairs of shoes with the dullest colours, perhaps so that onlookers could focus on how the shoes look. However, for fashion savvy people out there, wearing dull or neutral laces would just not work. So, for [&hellip;]</p>

Well, for me it is. I just find it convenient that shoelaces are the most affordable and convenient way to customize our shoes. I am quite amazed at how easily we can reinvent our old reliable pairs of shoes, just as long as we have enough pairs of shoelaces to use and choose from. Imagine going out every day for one whole week wearing only one pair of shoes for each day but your friends don’t notice and they simply think you’re wearing a unique one every [&hellip;]</p>

Among all the shoelaces she saw and after a careful comparison of all the shoelaces in my collection, she went on to say that she took a particular liking to my pair of blue round shoelaces. Well, I couldn’t blame her because in a sea of shoelaces that come in various colors, styles, patterns, and even prints, the blue round shoelaces really stand out in beauty and elegance. It is also one of my favorite pairs from my collection. Okay, let me back [&hellip;]</p>

It is still true that the mentioned qualities should be the priority when it comes to choosing your shoelaces, but we must never forget other shoelace features such as shoelace width and shape since these things also matter in determining whether or not your shoelaces would look good against your shoes and the rest of your outfit. To introduce you to these concepts, let me share to you my favorite width and shape combination when it comes to [&hellip;]</p>

This could make us wonder why after so many years, and even though manufacturers have found other materials to make new shoelaces with, leather shoelaces still continue to arguably be the most popular type of shoelaces. Well, to explain that simply, let me just say that class never goes out of style, and leather shoelaces could easily be declared as the classiest type of shoelaces you can get your hands (or feet) on out [&hellip;]</p>

Well, it figures especially since shoelaces are the easiest way to customize the look of your shoes – with shoestrings, you can easily get creative. Imagine only having one pair of shoes. Even though you have five pairs of shoelaces to alternate between every now and then, it would only be a matter of weeks before you get tired of all those shoelaces. Even if you have two pairs of shoes to alternate, it would still be a matter of time before [&hellip;]</p>
