<p>When it comes to travel, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you are an Elite Platinum Member or just a grandparent heading out for that once a year trip. You need to be concerned with your personal safety!</p>
<p>Below are 10 must know holiday hotel travel safety tips you should be aware of, before you even start packing. We want you to be ready when you make your first stop along the way.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s start with the basics. <strong>Always beware of your surroundings, when approaching your room.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let the attendant at the front desk publicize your room number.</strong> If he or she announces it out loud when giving you your key, ask for a different room. Have them write the number and hand it to you.</li>
<li><strong>When possible, avoid staying on the first floor.</strong> Many safety experts recommend occupying a room somewhere between the third and sixth floors &#8212; where rooms are high enough to be difficult to break into; but not so high that they&#8217;re out of the reach of most fire engine ladders.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the door to your room locked at all times.</strong> If you are inside the room, turn the deadbolt and fasten the security chain and or/the boat latch. I would also recommend investing in a portable doorstop alarm. This is an item you can find on our website.</li>
<li><strong>Check the locks on the windows (and balcony door, if applicable) as soon as you arrive, and notify the front desk if any are not functioning.</strong> It&#8217;s a good idea to check these locks again each time you return to the room, as housekeeping may open them and forget to close them.</li>
<li><strong>When you leave your hotel room, pull the door completely closed behind you.</strong> Make sure the latch has engaged. Take a moment before you leave to try the door and make sure it is secure.</li>
<li><strong>Use the security view-port (peephole) to see who is outside your door before opening it.</strong> Do not trust someone claiming to be a hotel employee if you are not expecting one. If you are unsure, call the front desk to check. Leave the security chain engaged while opening the door for further protection.</li>
<li><strong>When leaving your room, turn the TV or radio on, and/or put your &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; sign on the door.</strong> Both of these tricks will give potential thieves the impression that you&#8217;re still there. (You can contact the front desk to arrange a housekeeping visit even if the &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; sign is up.)</li>
<li><strong>The hotel parking lot and hallways should be well lit.</strong> Report any outages to the front desk and ask for a security escort if you feel unsafe. Always try to park under a light.</li>
<li><strong>When entering or leaving the hotel after dark, use the main entrance.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Can you believe the holiday shopping season is here? I laugh, now, looking back… My dad always had a backache the day after Thanksgiving; and now I know why. He didn&#8217;t want make the drive, fight the crowds, carry the packages and handle the kids while my mom shopped!</p>
<p>The one thing that hasn&#8217;t changed is that men still don’t like to go shopping, at least until Christmas Eve. What <em>has</em> changed is how dangerous it can be, if you aren&#8217;t aware of your surroundings. This is especially true for folks that don’t normally venture out to the mall or the big box stores during peak hours or with crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 7 simple safety tips to help make your holiday shopping experience a safe one!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tell someone where you plan to shop and about what time you expect to be home.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is especially important for those who don’t normally go out very early or late.</li>
<li>Leave a note or tell someone where you plan to shop just in case. This can be very valuable if there is an accident or worse. It gives family, friends and police an idea where and when to start looking if you don’t return.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Since holiday hours now start in the wee hours of the morning and go very late into the night, be sure to park under a light and as close to the entrance as possible.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Write down where you parked or even take a picture so you are not wandering looking for your car when you are ready to leave.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Always have your pepper spray in your hand when you are walking to and from the car.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minimize the amount of items you carry in your purse during the holidays.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Only carry one credit card and a minimal amount of cash.</li>
<li>Leave all the extra pictures and personal items at home.</li>
<li>Always put your purse inside the car and lock the door (keep out your keys) before you start loading the car. NEVER leave it sitting out in the cart.</li>
<li>If someone tries to steal your purse, LET IT GO!! It’s not worth your life!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Are you carrying more packages than you can manage? </strong>Can you barely see over the top of your cart?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make multiple trips to your car if you are shopping at a mall or strip center. You don’t want to have so many packages in your arms that you have to lean them against the car or leave them in the cart where someone can walk by and grab them.</li>
<li>Put all items in your trunk or cover under your hatch. Don’t leave anything visible to the public.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Avoid the ATM machines when possible.</strong> If you have to use one, go to a drive up and keep your pepper spray in your hand, only open the driver side window and stay alert to anyone around you.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Parking lots are a place where people come and go.</strong> Pay close attention if you notice anyone lingering and acting suspicious. If in doubt, call and report it.</li>
</ol>

		<p>A customer&#8217;s car was hit by a vehicle. She did the right thing, by calling in the claim; but one  thing she did wrong was NOT to have the appraiser come here to my garage to have it appraised. Instead, she took it to one of their drive-in quickie appraisal shops. BIG MISTAKE.</p>
<p>Later, she arrived here with the estimate in hand. When I perused it, I couldn&#8217;t believe how small an amount it was written up for. I told her before we do anything, she better call the insurance company and tell them she wanted it reappraised; or, at the very least, they should call me.</p>
<p>This morning the actual appraiser himself called me. I told him there were numerous things missing from the appraisal ;and boy was I surprised when he was honest with me, uttering the words, “Yeah I know, my boss likes me to write it up like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>HUH? Your boss likes to write it up for way less than it should be, to save money; so it will cost the customer money out of her own pocket?</p>
<p><a href="https://balancingacttv.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/estimate.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7173" src="https://balancingacttv.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/estimate.jpg?w=604&#038;h=514" alt="estimate" width="604" height="514" /></a></p>
<p>Usually, the insurance companies are spot-on with the assessments. Even generous, in some cases. I believe, that&#8217;s because we are basically watching over them.</p>
<p>Hopefully this isn&#8217;t a new trend and won&#8217;t be happening all the time; but make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen to you. Take your car to the mechanic/auto body shop you trust and have the appraiser go THERE. This is no different then anything else that needs an expert to oversee it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get shorted (or wrenched)!</p>

<p>It’s not just the trick or treating that makes Halloween fun for me &#8211; it’s also my birthday! My husband is one of the few men that can say he’s married to a real &#8220;witch&#8221; and get away with it!</p>
<p>As a child, I spent my birthdays trick or treating; and as an adult walking with the kids as they went door-to-door. The number one rule for us was only going to houses that had their lights on.</p>
<p>Well, times have definitely changed and I want to share some safety tips with you that you may have not considered.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When picking a costume with a mask check the following:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Can you easily see out of it?</li>
<li>Can it be quickly removed?</li>
<li>Is it well ventilated for easy breathing?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Does your costume have a bottom?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is it easy to walk in?</li>
<li>If it’s adult costume, can you drive in it?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Before you head out knocking on doors take time to check the</strong> <a href="http://www.nsopw.gov/">national sex offender registry</a><strong> for your neighborhood.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Most local city &amp; county agencies have this information available.</li>
<li>Avoid these homes</li>
<li>If you know a home is registered to a sex offender &amp; they have lights on and decorations out, report them to local authorities immediately!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Parents always carry a flashlight &amp; peppers spray with you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If kids are uncomfortable going to a house because it looks too spooky, walk up with them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never enter anyone’s home to accept candy even if it’s just for a minute.</strong> Always wait outside.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Respect people’s personal space and don’t let anyone within your personal space.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Just because it’s Halloween doesn’t mean it’s ok to walk up to just anyone.</li>
<li>If you are uncomfortable be sure to keep your distance or ask that person to step back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Be mindful/respectful of what time it is.</strong>
<ul>
<li>If it’s 10:00 pm &amp; the trick or treaters are long gone, don’t open your door to a random.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>ALWAYS walk in groups or pairs.</strong> It’s never safe to walk alone.</li>
<li><strong>Check all candy/items before eating them.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Only eat factory wrapped candy.</li>
<li>If a piece of candy looks questionable, throw it away!</li>

<p><em>By Jenny Schafer</em></p>
<p>Hollywood is having a baby boom. And some of our favorite celebrity moms are welcoming their babies at home.</p>
<p>While home births still constitute less than 1 percent of total births in the United States, births at home have increased 50 percent since 2004, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Continue reading about 10 celebrity moms – including <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>, Alyson Hannigan and <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/category/gisele-bundchen">Gisele Bündchen</a>  &#8211; who had home births.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Supermarket Superstar</em> host <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/22/keibler-welcomes-grace">Stacy Keibler</a> and her husband Jared Pobre welcomed their first child on August 20, she announced on her website. The <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> alum welcomed daughter, Ava Grace, via home birth.</p>
<p>“Jared and I have been blessed with the new love of our lives,” the proud new mom <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/22/keibler-welcomes-grace">announced</a>. “Ava Grace Pobre was born at home on Wednesday, August 20th. We’ve never experienced a level of joy and happiness like this before! Thank you so much for all of the special wishes and positive energy.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Omarion’s girlfriend Apryl Jones</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Former B2K singer <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/09/omarion-welcomes-omari">Omarion</a>, 29, and his girlfriend <strong>Apryl Jones</strong> have welcomed their first child – a son – the proud papa announced via Instagram August 9. “World. Allow me to introduce. MEGAA OMARI GRANDBERRY. He is 7 pounds. 4oz &amp; 20 inches long,” he captioned the sweet snapshot holding his newborn in his arms.</p>
<p>“My son I’ve been waiting on you,” the R&amp;B singer continued.</p>
<p>The new dad went on to gush about his “soul mate,” who welcomed their son via home birth.</p>
<p>“God is the realist!! I witnessed a miracle,” he added. “My soul mate @aprylsjones is so strong! Not only did she have a un medicated birth (no drugs) she did it at home. Naturally. Just like my mom had me. I love you. thank you for having my legacy. I’ll forever belong to you &amp; you will forever be tied to me. Creating a child takes no love or skill but being a parent requires lots of both. Thanks for watching me grow. #MEGAAhome #OmarionsonMEGAA #donthateonmysonsnameillkillya #Nolol #royalObloodline #blasain #mysongotgoodhair #freshpitthewombhandsom alright. I love y’all.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thandie Newton</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>During an appearance on TODAY, <em>Rogue</em> actress <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/04/15/thandie-newton-introduces">Thandie Newton</a> talked about the joys of home birth. The mom-of-three proudly said she birthed her son <strong>Booker</strong>, now 6 months, at home on her bathroom floor.</p>
<p>When asked why she had all three of her kids at home – she and husband Ol Parker are also parents to daughters <strong>Ripley</strong>, 13, and <strong>Nico</strong>, 9 – the <em>Mission: Impossible II</em> actress said she feels much more comfortable at home.</p>
<p><em>“I’d never been in hospital as a child or as an adult really, and I just associated hospital with being ill,” she said of her decision. “And I felt beautiful and healthy and wonderful when I was pregnant, and being at home was the place I felt most relaxed and comfortable.”</em></p>
<p>She went on to talk about the taboo topic, saying that home births used to be the norm.</p>
<p><em>“There was a time when everyone had their babies at home,” the Crash star, 41, said. “It wasn’t such a big deal. It’s more about as a woman what do you feel most comfortable doing, and you make the choice, and I chose to be at home.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/04/07/alyson-hannigan-smiles">Alyson Hannigan</a> has quickly become one of our favorite celebrity moms since the birth of her first child, Satyana, in March 2009. <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2012/02/27/alyson-hannigan-18">Celebrity Baby Scoop</a> sat down with the <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> star and asked about her drug-free homebirth.</p>
<p>“Yes. I did use a midwife and a doula,” she said. “We had the option of having a doctor there, but even he said you’ll only need me if you need to be transferred to the hospital–which thankfully, I did not need.”</p>
<p>Before welcoming her second daughter, Keeva, the <em>American Pie</em> star said she faced many fear-based comments about going forward with another home birth.</p>
<p>“Yes, we had lots of comments about it,” Alyson said. “And we had the doctor that scared us tremendously. There was definitely more concern the first time around. For me, that was just the perfect place. I am absolutely terrified of hospitals. so I think that the home is the best place for me to feel comfortable. I had a midwife, her assistant and a doula. It will be the same again this time.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2010/11/15/mayim-bialik-shares-her-homebirth-story">Mayim Bialik</a> has really ‘blossomed’ into an amazing and outspoken mother! An advocate of attachment parenting, Mayim also empowers women to consider medication-free home births.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Big Bang Theory</em> star and mother of two talked about her second son’s home birth, while her elder son watched.</p>
<p>“Fred, yes, was born at home, and Miles was able to watch the whole thing from his high chair while eating granola,” she said. “Fortunately it was a very fast labor because I think Miles would’ve been bored if it was longer than the hour and a half it was. He loves it, he still talks about it. It was something we talked about with our pediatrician, and believed very strongly in older siblings being present, and giving the choice. We gave him a choice before, we prepared him with videos about homebirth that our midwife prepared. Even during, I said, “If Miles wants to go the next room he can!” But he said, “No, I fine!” He got freaked out by the blood, but it was still nice.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alanis Morissette</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>On Christmas Day 2011, <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/05/morissette-shares-breastfeeding">Alanis Morissette</a> and her husband Mario Treadway welcomed their son Ever into their home with the help of a midwife and a doula.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really even imagine myself having the birth experience in the hospital,” Morissette told <a href="http://www.today.com/parents/alanis-morissette-home-birth-was-beyond-pain-4B11216386"><em>Today</em></a>. “My home is like my little sanctuary.”</p>
<p>She added: “My husband was at my side the whole time, my total hero. And the rest was really up to God.”</p>
<p>Throughout her home birth, the singer says she tapped into an inner strength.</p>
<p>“The experience was beyond pain,” she admitted. “It was a transcendental experience. I just went to this whole other world. I basically had to be the little soldier that I am and really focus on this new beautiful creature coming out of me.”</p>
<p>She went on to talk about the joys of home birth.</p>
<p>“I think once people know it’s quite possible to have a really amazing home birth — and in my case I have no regrets and would do it again and in the same breath it wasn’t the easiest experience of my life — I think having it be an option is really exciting,” she shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most outspoken celebrity moms on natural birth is supermodel <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>. The former Victoria’s Secret model gave birth to her first child Benjamin in December 2009 and has openly <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2010/02/02/gisele-b-ndchens-natural-birth-didnt-hurt-in-the-slightest">spoken</a> about her drug-free and pain-free home water birth.</p>
<p><em>“My delivery was in a bath tub, in water,” Gisele said. “I wanted to have a home birth. I wanted to be very aware and present during the birth… I didn’t want to be drugged up. So I did a lot of preparation, I did yoga and meditation, so I managed to have a very tranquil birth at home. It didn’t hurt in the slightest. The whole time my mind was focused in each contraction on the thought ‘my baby is closer to coming out.’”</em></p>
<p>A few weeks later the supermodel looked svelte on the cover of <em>Vogue</em> and <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/node/33865">spoke</a> of her “empowered” birth experience.</p>
<p><em>“I wanted to experience the transformation,” the model mom said. “It was the most amazing experience of my life, feeling him come through my body. And once he was born, I never felt so empowered as looking at him and thinking, Oh, my God, we did it together!”</em></p>
<p>The Brazilian beauty later <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2010/03/08/gisele-b-ndchen-i-am-a-very-happy-proud-mother">wrote</a> on her blog:</p>
<p><em>“I am blessed to have been able to have a home birth surrounded by love, where I was able to feel safe,” she wrote. “It was a powerful experience. I never felt so vulnerable but so strong at the same time. It was amazing to experience my body become free to do what it was made to do by allowing my mind and my body to let go and be free to experience the changes taking place within… I was just there… focusing on my breathing and relaxing the best that I could… so present, to witness the biggest miracle in my life happen before my very own eyes. To give life to another being, what a gift!”</em></p>
<p>As well, Gisele added her voice to the <a href="http://celebritybabyscoop.com/2012/01/10/gisele-b-ndchen">Birth Around the World Project</a> to help promote the humanization of birth.</p>
<p><em>“I had the opportunity to experience the natural process of birth and it was one of the most life changing experiences for me and very very special!,” she said. “I believe it’s a woman’s right to make the decision about how she’s going to give birth to her child. And it’s also her right to have access to the information she needs so she can make that decision from a place of awareness, and not a place of fear.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evangeline Lilly</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lost</em> star <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2011/10/11/evangeline-lilly-i-pushed-for-8-hours">Evangeline Lilly</a> welcomed son Kahekili Kali in May 2011 and <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2011/10/10/evangeline-lilly-i-pushed-for-8-hours">shared</a> her birth story.</p>
<p><em>“I actually skipped the hospital … We decided to have the baby at home because we wanted it to be a natural birth, and it turns out that it was 30 hours of natural,” she shared.</em></p>
<p>Of those thirty hours, Evangeline says a full eight were spent pushing!</p>
<p><em>“Eight hours of pushing, that’s the part that men don’t understand.” the Canadian beauty</em> <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2011/10/11/evangeline-lilly-i-pushed-for-8-hours"><em>added</em></a><em>. “Women go, ‘Oh, dear, oh, dear God, eight hours of pushing?’ And the men are like, ‘Okay, eight hours of pushing. After about five hours of pushing, my midwife and my birthing assistant said, ‘You know, we have a few suggestions,’” she says. “And I was like, ‘Really? After five hours of pushing you have a few suggestions? You couldn’t have told me five minutes in?’</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ricki Lake</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ricki Lake</strong>’s documentary about home birth, <em>The Business of Being Born</em>, empowered women everywhere to have unmedicated births at home. She gave birth to her second son Owen, now 13, at home in a bathtub. She <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ricki-lake/ricki-lake-on-the-busines_b_46002.html">talked</a> about her reasons for making the film.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make this movie after my two very different birth experiences with my children,” she said. “I felt like I had an opportunity to explore and question birthing practices in this country and perhaps be an advocate for mothers’ rights and better maternity care.”</p>
<p>On the experience of birthing Owen at home, Ricki said:</p>
<p><em>“After the birth of my sons, particularly my home birth with my second son, I thought I wanted to become a midwife,” she shared. “Then I looked at all the years of schooling and training that I would have to do and felt that the time could be better spent doing a documentary on the subject of birth.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Model mom-of-two <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/31/cindy-crawford-presleys">Cindy Crawford</a> had both of her children – son Presley and daughter Kaia – at home with her husband Rande Gerber and three midwives on hand.</p>
<p>She <a href="http://www.babyworld.co.uk/information/birth/homebirth/celeb_homebirths.asp">spoke</a> of the home birth experience:</p>
<p><em>“I didn’t tell anyone last time because a lot of people are against home birth and tell you horror stories,” she shared. “Even my husband said at first, ‘Why are we doing this?’” But she went on to say her home birth was ‘absolutely surreal.’”</em></p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that the kids are heading back to school already! At least, while they are in school, there is that small sigh of relief knowing that they are safe. It’s getting to and from that always makes me a little nervous. We are extra cautious at the beginning of the year, with the little ones when they start out; but as the year goes by, maybe we don’t pay as much attention as we once did. It addition to our simple tips, below I strongly encourage you to visit the <a href="http://www.nsopw.gov/en-US/Registry">National Sex Offender Registry</a> before you children head out the door!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Will your child be walking or riding a bike to school this year?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make the trip with them a couple of times so you are both comfortable with the route.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Time how long it takes for them to travel each way, walking or riding.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This gives you an idea what time they should arrive A.M. &amp; P.M.</li>
<li>If they have a cell phone ask them to call/text when they leave &amp; arrive both ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>If there is another child in the neighborhood going to the same school, try to arrange for them to travel together. </strong>There is safety in numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Point out “safe places” for them along the way (if there are any) in case of an emergency.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will your children be riding the bus this year?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure they are familiar with the bus number. It’s better to miss a bus &amp; remain at school with adults that can help instead of taking the wrong one &amp; nobody knows where you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Wait in a group at the bus stop.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Don’t ever leave the group to walk up to a car that approaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Never allow your child to “ride” with anyone unless they are on your “safe list”.</strong>
<ul>
<li>A safe list tells your child the ONLY people they are ever allowed to go with if it’s not you. This includes walking, riding or even approaching a car. It’s that serious!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Communicate!</strong> If your child is expressing concern or feeling uncomfortable find out why &amp; take action. Children have great instincts. Listen to them.</li>

<p><em>By Jenny Schafer</em></p>
<p>Celebrity Baby Scoop is joining in on the <a href="http://herscoop.com/posts/join-bucket-challenge/">Ice Bucket Challenge</a> for ALS.</p>
<p>In the trending campaign, people are asking 2-3 of their friends to dump a bucket of ice water over their heads. If your friends do not accept the challenge within 24 hours, they must donate $100 to an ALS association of choice.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IceBucketChallenge&amp;src=tyah">#IceBucketChallenge</a> has literally soaked some celebrities, including <strong>Justin Timerlake</strong>, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> and <strong>Martha Stewart</strong>. Not to mention, some of our favorite celebrity parents such as Gwen Stefani, <strong>Nicole Richie</strong>, Jessica Alba and<strong> Gavin Rossdale</strong>. Check out Gwen and Gavin’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152766651764873&amp;set=vb.19074699872&amp;type=2&amp;theater">video</a> here, and then see their 8-year-old son Kingston also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152766862649873&amp;set=vb.19074699872&amp;type=2&amp;theater">take on the challenge</a>. </p>
<p>Pop superstar <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> also took the challenge, and got some help from her 6-year-old twins <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Emme</strong>. The <em>Jenny From the Block</em> singer, 45, shared the video via <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r0U2DSGuGI/?modal=true">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>And we loved <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>‘s funny Ice Bucket Challenge via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=551430364984205&amp;set=vb.100003517394930&amp;type=2&amp;theater">Facebook</a>, where he got playful with his wife, fellow actress <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2014/08/15/jennifer-garners-buddies">Jennifer Garner</a>, and their daughters <strong>Violet</strong>, 8, and <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 5, erupted in contagious giggles when he threw her into their backyard pool.</p>
<p>Often referred to as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, <a href="http://herscoop.com/posts/steve-gleason-calls/">ALS</a> is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Celebrity Baby Scoop’s senior editor, Jenny Schafer, lost her father to ALS and created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=527671644034555&amp;set=vb.220463401422049&amp;type=2&amp;theater">her own video</a> to challenge a few Hollywood moms. </p>

<p>Next up for the challenge was <strong>Courtney Lopez</strong>. Check out this priceless <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r0flinCwTw/?modal=true">Instagram</a> video, showing her support for the cause — with some help from her adorable 3 1/2-year-old daughter <strong>Gia</strong>.</p>

<p>“And I nominate @evalongoria and @kearrangiovanni ! #doit,” she continues.</p>
<p>Courtney’s husband, <em>Extra</em> host <a href="http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2012/07/16/mario-lopez-gia-beach-babes">Mario Lopez</a>, couldn’t help but show his support. The <em>Saved by the Bell</em> alum, 40, went on to tweeting about their video.</p>

In fact, she can&#039;t remember a time when she wasn&#039;t obsessed with technology. Carley and her husband made a lifetime (modem) connection writing love letters over AOL— back when you needed one of those CDs to log on.


It was after becoming a life coach and founding her company Mothercraft, that she began helping busy moms simplify their lives with simple tips. Her weekly newsletter, The Juicebox, had a loyal following, but the true &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment came when Carley started attaching videos clips to her tips and her subscriber base skyrocketed. And Bam!, the concept for Digitwirl was born. Carley has held various creative positions in digital Hollywood, building some of the first-ever film and television websites for clients like Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. She is a regular contributor for Lifetime&#039;s The Balancing Act and she&#039;s offered her tech tips on ABC News and Fox News. When she&#039;s not scouring the virtual globe for next revolutionary gadget or life-changing website or app, she can be found wailing on her RockBand drum kit. Her husband and two children are often allowed to play too.

She has been a ski instructor in Western Canada, an orchard worker in Israel, and a member of her college sky diving club!  Harriet has spent most of her professional career working as an economist, policy advocate and educator. Harriet worked with the Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario governments in Canada, and spent 13 years at the United Nations as a representative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Harriet followed many of the United Nations environmental and sustainable development committees and conferences for the IMF &ndash; including the first UN Earth Summit - at United Nations headquarters in New York and around the world.  


In the spring of 2007 Harriet was selected from thousands of individuals across 
the country to participate in a training program conducted by Former Vice President Al Gore and sponsored by The Climate Project. Harriet is one of the first 1000 individuals from around the world who have been personally trained by Mr. Gore to educate the public on climate change. Harriet will tell you this has been a transformational time in her life. Harriet has spoken with thousands of individuals around the United States on climate change and global warming on behalf of The Climate Project. Harriet is proud to be a Climate Project Presenter and credits her work with TCP for inspiring her to create and launch ClimateMama.com, Harriet&acute;s passion and adventure!

Launched in late 2009, ClimateMama.com is a climate change education, advocacy and advisory organization, targeted at parents of all ages who want to learn more about climate change, what it&acute;s all about, and what THEY can do about it! Harriet works with colleges, school children and their parents, educators, businesses, PTA groups and houses of worships that are interested in learning more about what actions they can take to help make our world a better place. 

Of the many &ldquo;hats&rdquo; Harriet wears, she will tell you that the most important hat is one she put on in 1998 and continues to wear to this day, and that is Mom to her two children. Becoming a mom heightened Harriet&acute;s desire to find a way to &ldquo;make the world a better place&rdquo;, not only for her children, but for all the children around us, even the grown up ones. Through her work on Climate Change, Harriet feels she has found her passion, her opportunity and the ability to help raise awareness on THE most important and challenging issue any of us will face in our lives.

Working at a grassroots level, Harriet has successfully spearheaded a program to bring recycling into her local school district. She &ldquo;brought to life&rdquo; an outdoor classroom at her children&acute;s elementary school, coordinating the design, planning and fundraising for the project. Harriet serves as the chair of her town&acute;s Environmental Commission and sits on and chairs several community based environmental groups. As well, Harriet works with local and national organizations helping houses of worship &ldquo;green&rdquo; their programs and is a vocal advocate for legislative action on climate change and renewable energy.

Harriet lives in New Jersey with her husband and two children who are her passion and inspiration for everything she does. Harriet loves hiking, skiing, traveling and all things outdoors

However, her professional skills overlapped into her role as a mother - every birthday party was approached like an integrated marketing campaign; every holiday assigned an innovative theme with broad family appeal.
	
Happily married for 13 years, Michelle has been a busy, engaged, stay-at-home mom of three kids, a dog, and a tortoise for nine of them.  Michelle became engaged in political issues during the 2008 Presidential campaign and, again, merged her learned skills in both advertising and motherhood with her new passion – politics.  The idea for O-MAMA was born.  Michelle now spends her days talking with moms all across America, as well as the media, empowering moms to be a voice in the country&#039;s most important conversations. 
	
About O-MAMA&#039;s Republican Voice:  Debbie Devine	
Nothing is ordinary about this Southern California Republican.  She grew up in Corona del Mar, CA, graduated from the University of Southern California, and was raised by parents who are still married after 45 years. Typical. But Debbie studied abroad, became fluent in Spanish, and spent her career years working for Telemundo, CNN en Español, and CNN International, where she helped launch television programs and networks in Spain, Mexico, and Turkey. Surprise!	
Finally, motherhood took precedence and Deb traded in her international globe-trotting career for a second one teaching Spanish.  She owns and operates a student travel business that takes middle school and high school students to Latin America to help them become global citizens. Her goal is to get kids :out of the bubble&quot; of the United States, use their language skills and perform community service projects. 	 
Debbie is a divorced mother of two great kids and a dog.  Her enthusiasm for motherhood, teaching, travel, and news is infectious.  O-MAMA integrates all of her experiences and interests and she and Michelle enjoy sharing their passion with America&#039;s moms on the site as well as spreading the message and mission of O-MAMA to a national audience.

Michelle&#039;s Story

Michelle first became known in the magazine publishing world. She turned around Emilio Estefan and Ocean Drive Media&acute;s struggling print magazine (with zero marketing budget or new hires) by identifying new revenue streams, developing innovative sales and marketing strategies, and employing email and newsletter marketing tactics (before they were all the rage.) 

In early 2007, Michelle left and launched Mivista Consulting, Inc. to help small businesses achieve their own turnarounds. On the side, she began providing live educational programs, online articles and videos to help those who couldn&#039;t afford or didn&#039;t desire full-blown consulting/coaching to learn the same business concepts and skills in a fun, interactive and hands-on environment. Mivista Workshops &amp; Seminars was born.

Since then, MIVISTA has developed a series of workshops open-to-the-public, which has captivated thousands and generated a large and loyal following. This success has drawn major sponsors and clients like Constant Contact, HSBC and Costco, who either hire Michelle to train their teams or use her events as a platform to engage a professional, high-level audience.

She remembers distinctly the first time she put her son down on grass and he cried. Actually, she did too.  Many years later, they have all acclimated to life in the &#039;burbs, understand that the wild animal in their backyard is a woodchuck and not a beaver, and have figured out that all roads lead to the mall.
In addition to blogging for The Balancing Act, Tracy writes the syndicated humor column, LOST IN SUBURBIA&reg; which is carried weekly by over 400 newspapers in 25 states and reaches an audience of over 3.5 million readers.  She is also the author of the recently published humor book, Rebel without a Minivan: Observations on Life in the &#039;Burbs, and is a contributor to a new humor compilation called, See Mom Run:  Side-Splitting Essays from the World&#039;s Most Harried Moms.” Beckerman also writes a daily blog about her musings on marriage, motherhood, and dogs that get into the garbage and throw up on the rug.
Tracy has appeared on The Today Show on NBC, the CBS Early Show, LX New York, Better TV, CBS Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood, and numerous radio and print interviews speaking about motherhood and life in the &#039;burbs.  She also has performed stand-up at the Comic Strip Live in NYC, and other venues.
Prior to her life as a mommy, writer and blogger, Tracy was a writer and producer in the television industry for ten years, managing the Advertising &amp; Promotion department at WCBS-TV New York, and creating award-winning TV and radio scripts for such clients as Lifetime Television, WCBS-TV, CBS and NBC.  Her numerous honors for writing include The Erma Bombeck Humor Writers Workshop Award, a Writer&#039;s Guild of America award, a CLIO, International Film and Television awards, and a New York Emmy&reg;.
