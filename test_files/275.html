			<p>We are obsessed with our personal image in this day and age. It&#8217;s impossible not to be, because let&#8217;s face it image is everything.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have the power to sculpt ourselves into whatever we wish to be. It&#8217;s not easy, but the hard work pays off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a healthy curvy mademoiselle measuring at 32-25-38. However, I am working towards losing a couple of pounds and toning my body. And of course Dita Von Teese is my inspiration! She is the most beautiful woman in the world!</p>
<p>In this blog I&#8217;ll be documenting my weight loss journey and share other interests such as beauty, fashion, well-being and whatever else I&#8217;d like to share. I&#8217;m quite the straight talker so no prudes allowed!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy my blog and I would love to hear what you have to say.</p>

<article class="article">For a long time, I was completely convinced that The Good Life looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yearly international vacations at luxury resorts</li>
<li>Impressive, four-course meals at trendy restaurants</li>
<li>Double-take worthy jewelry and a certain brand of red-soled shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>But these days, I place a lot more value on freedom and time … Time to pursue my passions, hang out with my honey, drink wine with my ladies and hike through the Hollywood Hills as the sun sets.</p>
<p>Sounds nice, right? It’s totally possible to live a fulfilling, engaged, love-every-minute-of-it life without bouncing checks.</p>
<p>Here are 35 of my favorite ways to do just that.</p>
<p><strong>1. Plant some flowers in your garden.</strong></p>
<p>They’ll make your space look lovely and welcoming and you can cut them later to display in your home.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use YouTube videos for karaoke.</strong></p>
<p>Have fun all alone or invite friends to join. Host a themed party or just have a one-person sing off.</p>
<p><strong>3. Have a movie marathon with close friends.</strong></p>
<p>Watch your favorite movies from your childhood or those cheesy rom-coms your guy will never watch with you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rearrange your furniture.</strong></p>
<p>What happens if you put the loveseat under the front window? Or if you move the TV out of the bedroom? (Good things, that’s what!)</p>
<p><strong>5. Take a photo a every day for a year.</strong></p>
<p>If you need some inspiration, check out the photo-a-day lists <a href="http://fatmumslim.com.au/photo-a-day-challenge-lists-see-them-all-here/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. Take a nap in front of the fireplace or in a patch of sun on the carpet.</strong></p>
<p>Naps: they’re not just for cats and toddlers! You’ll feel so refreshed when you wake up.</p>
<p><strong>7. Visit a museum on a free day.</strong></p>
<p>Consider checking out those museums you’d never normally visit, like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-museum-of-questionable-medical-devices-saint-paul" target="_blank">The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices</a> or <a href="http://mustardmuseum.com/" target="_blank">The National Mustard Museum</a>. (Both real.)</p>
<p><strong>8. Wash your car at home.</strong></p>
<p>The bucket, the sponge, the jean shorts — the whole nine.</p>
<p><strong>9. Donate hair to cancer patients.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re ready to cut off at least 10 inches, consider donating it to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/" target="_blank">Locks of Love</a> and then rock that stylish pixie cut!</p>
<p><strong>10. Window shop.</strong></p>
<p>Drive to the fanciest neighborhood you know, bring a big travel mug of coffee, and peer into the windows with your BFF. Discuss whether or not you’d ever wear that $375 sweater.</p>
<p><strong>11. Finish a book in one sitting.</strong></p>
<p>When was the last time you did this? Fifth grade? Do it all over again with some fun chick lit or a good YA book. The <em>Divergent</em> books are great!</p>
<p><strong>12. Get rid of clutter.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll feel soooo much better and you might unearth a few treasures you&#8217;ll want to start using again.</p>
<p><strong>13. Listen to a podcast.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re feeling multitask-y, listen to a podcast that will improve your career or personal life. Or just listen to something fun! I love <a href="http://themoth.org/radio" target="_blank">The Moth</a> and <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/" target="_blank">This American Life</a> (the most recent episode is free on the website).</p>
<p><strong>14. Go on a bike ride.</strong></p>
<p>It’s free, it’s good exercise, and it&#8217;s a great way to explore your city.</p>
<p><strong>15. Prepare a care package for the homeless.</strong></p>
<p>Next time you’re at a highway off-ramp and someone is asking for change, you’ll have something to give them.</p>
<p><strong>16. Paint your nails.</strong></p>
<p>Do something silly or colorful or add some nail art if you’re feeling creative.</p>
<p><strong>17. Gaze at the stars.</strong></p>
<p>Can you find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra" target="_blank">Lyra</a>? Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)" target="_blank">Sagittarius</a>? Try to find them on your own without Googling &#8217;em.</p>
<p><strong>18. Organize your makeup.</strong></p>
<p>So gratifying! Throw away the broken eyeshadows, wash your brushes, and fall in love with red lipstick again.</p>
<p><strong>19. Visit a local beach.</strong></p>
<p>Just about anything — reading, eating, journaling — is more fun if you do it next to a body of water. If you&#8217;re landlocked, head for the best park you know.</p>
<p><strong>20. Practice yoga.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t know how? Search <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XUx6GJOkaI" target="_blank">YouTube for free classes</a> or sequences or check out a book from the library.</p>
<p><strong>21. Go for a run around the neighborhood.</strong></p>
<p>Explore the alleys or try a street you’ve never been down before. Examine everything from the landscaping and shutter colors.</p>
<p><strong>22. Go for a drive.</strong></p>
<p>Did your grandparents do this all the time? It’s a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon! Go explore a small town nearby or a neighborhood you don&#8217;t know well.</p>
<p><strong>23. Go camping in your backyard.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking tent, sleeping bags, lantern, the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>24. Take your pet out for a walk.</strong></p>
<p>And just this once, let her sniff everything she wants for as long as she wants.</p>
<p><strong>25. Take a bath. In milk and rose petals!</strong></p>
<p>You’ll feel like a decadent Cleopatra and your skin will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>26. Have a picnic using what you already have in the fridge.</strong></p>
<p>Pass up that trip to the market for wine and cheese. What if you had a picnic of carrots and hummus and some leftover pasta salad? It’s still fun!</p>
<p><strong>27. Put together a list of your favorite recipes and email them to friends or family.</strong></p>
<p>I bet your sister would love that recipe for Grandma’s cookies or Mom’s twice-baked-potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>28. Go hiking.</strong></p>
<p>Lace up your sneakers and head to the nearest state park.</p>
<p><strong>29. Visit with family or friends.</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a cousin who lives in your city who you never see? Invite him over for a potluck dinner.</p>
<p><strong>30. Write a bucket list.</strong></p>
<p>What do you want to do before you check out? Get started by writing it all down.</p>
<p><strong>31. Dance in the rain.</strong></p>
<p>Bonus points if you do it where your neighbors can see you.</p>
<p><strong>32. Create a new ice cream flavor by combining all the flavors you have in your freezer.</strong></p>
<p>And add the best bits from your cupboard: peanuts! dried fruit! potato chips!</p>
<p><strong>33. Have a garage sale (after you re-organize your closets).</strong></p>
<p>Take out that roll of masking tape and start pricing.</p>
<p><strong>34. Download free meditation apps.</strong></p>
<p>They’ll make you feel sooooo much calmer and more centered.</p>
<p><strong>35. Make a “mix tape” playlists for friends.</strong></p>
<p>On the theme of &#8220;Our Spring Break Adventure circa 2002&#8243; or &#8220;Songs You’re Too Embarrassed To Admit You Like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at all that fun to be had! And you&#8217;ll barely drop a dime! Use the money you saved to put toward something big and exciting that gets you closer to your goals and the life you want.</p>

<p><b>“One day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it’s worth watching.” ~Unknown</b></p>
<p>Do you have a dream? A wish? A desire?</p>
<p>Do you ever wake up and wonder: What would it be like to love life?</p>
<p>People can tell you “follow your dream,” but is anyone really doing it?</p>
<p>Not someone in a TV show or movie—a real, living, breathing, human, just like you?</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>The Depression</p>
<p>Three years ago I couldn’t sleep. Night after night, I’d lie awake at 2am. My heart would pound in my chest.</p>
<p>The anxiety overtook me. I welcomed it. If I fell back asleep, the next time I woke I would head back to that place. The place I despised.</p>
<p>Fifty hours a week to a job that was slowly, inch by inch, sucking the life out of me.</p>
<p>I was twenty-six years old, but I didn’t feel twenty-six. I felt old, tired, and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I remember that night. Staring in the mirror. I could barely look at myself. The breathing in my chest pushing in and out rapidly. Tears rushing down my face. I was a grown man, or at least I was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Allowing Fear to Stop You</p>
<p>I was so scared. I’d put all my work experience, degrees, and life into my career. Yet, I hated it.</p>
<p>I had gone all in—and I was losing.</p>
<p>I couldn’t argue with the tears flowing down my cheeks. Something needed to change.</p>
<p>Follow The Dream</p>
<p>I know what it’s like to feel depressed, lost, and burned out. But I also know what it’s like to follow a dream.</p>
<p>I’m now thirty years old, and my life is a lot different than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Soon after that experience, I made a commitment to discover and follow my dream.</p>
<p>What’s my dream? I want to become a ninja.</p>
<p>Not a ninja in the traditional sense. It’s a childhood dream.</p>
<p><b>Over the course of four years I quit my job in America, moved to Japan, and now I train extensively in martial arts.</b></p>
<p>I arrive at the dojo at 7:30am Monday through Friday. Over the next year of my life I will train over 1,000 hours in Aikido (a martial art).</p>
<p>I’m living, breathing proof that it’s possible to follow a dream.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to wake up each morning. I love my life in a manner I never knew possible. But this post isn’t about me—it’s about all of us. More importantly, it’s about all of our dreams.</p>
<p>I hope with all my heart, today is the day that you begin the journey to turn your dream into a reality.</p>
<h2><b>15 Reasons to Start Following Your Dream Today</b></h2>
<h4><b>1. You’ve always wanted to do this.</b></h4>
<p>When I think about the question: If you had a million dollars what would you do with your life? I can now say, “Exactly what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>You’ve always wanted to follow your dream—so start today!</p>
<h4><b>2. You’ll experience things you never could have imagined.</b></h4>
<p>I’ve taken Japanese tea lessons with fifty-year-old woman. I’m learning a new language. I eat foods that I never knew existed.</p>
<p>The pursuit of a dream will give you experiences you never thought possible.</p>
<h4><b>3. You will become courageous.</b></h4>
<p>At some point your dream will mean so much to you that you will stop at nothing. When the dream overtakes you, no matter what your fears are you will not allow it to stop you.</p>
<p>You will stare your fears in the face. You will become a courageous person.</p>
<h4><b>4. You will become an inspiration to those around you.</b></h4>
<p>By doing what I want to do instead of what others want from me, I have been able to inspire others to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>Focus on your dreams, not what others want you to do, and you will do the same.</p>
<h4><b>5. You will realize the incredible things you are capable of doing.</b></h4>
<p>When you step forward to pursue your dream, you will face challenges you never could have anticipated. You will allow nothing to stop you. You will shock yourself at your ability to plow through any situation.</p>
<h4><b>6. You will like yourself more.</b></h4>
<p>You will feel excited and energized by the life you are choosing to live. You will feel proud of what you are doing. And you will like yourself more for it.</p>
<h4><b>7. Life will become beautiful.</b></h4>
<p>As you realize your own potential, you will realize the potential in others. You will start to recognize the beauty that life, you, and others have to offer.</p>
<h4><b>8. Your joy and happiness will become contagious.</b></h4>
<p>When people are around you, they will feel better about themselves and life because you are living proof it is possible to live a dream!</p>
<h4><b>9. You will connect on a deeper level with the force of the universe.</b></h4>
<p>The pursuit of a dream requires an act of faith. You step forward and take action. When you do this, you will face experiences that will bring you closer to the force of the universe.</p>
<h4><b>10. You will smile more.</b></h4>
<p>Life is better when you smile more. If you follow your dream, you will enjoy yourself and this will happen!</p>
<h4><b>11. It will give meaning to everything you do.</b></h4>
<p>Before I started following my dream I would often wonder, “What’s the point?”</p>
<p>Now, I know the answer to that question! Every action I take brings me closer to my dream.</p>
<h4><b>12. The food will taste better.</b></h4>
<p>Yup, you read that right! When you step forward with your dream you will feel more alive and you will better appreciate all the beauty life has to offer. So, yes! Even the food tastes better.</p>
<h4><b>13. Every day you will learn new things.</b></h4>
<p>Every day I learn more Japanese, more martial arts, and more about myself. I’m challenged and excited. The deeper I get in my dream, the more I learn.</p>
<h4><b>14. Your happiness will show on your face.</b></h4>
<p>It’s true! When you are optimistic, excited, and happy, guess what? You are drastically more attractive.</p>
<p>At twenty-six I looked stressed out and overwhelmed. At thirty I look happy and excited because I<i> am</i> happy and excited.</p>
<h4><b>15. You will love being around you.</b></h4>
<p>When we pursue a dream, we are connecting with our heart’s desires. It’s a way of telling our soul “I love you.”</p>
<p>It’s pretty great to hang out with people you love—especially when it’s yourself!</p>
<p>What has stopped you from following your dream?</p>

			<p>“It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct,” Sigmund Freud said.</p>
<p>There’s always a tension between how much we should follow our instincts and how much we should yield to social conventions. But at times like ours, the tendency is to tilt too far toward our instincts, since the conventions are changing fast and there’s no consensus about them anyway. There’s a risk in that. You don’t know whom you might be offending or how you might be sabotaging your own success.</p>
<p>The original etiquette manuals of Western civilization were in fact success manuals. As author Steven Pinker notes, they taught knights and nobles how to conduct themselves in the court of the king—which is where we get the concepts of “courtly” and “courtesy.”</p>
<p>[See <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/04/22/put-down-that-knife-how-good-manners-saved-the-world/" target="_self">this related post</a> for more on the history of manners, including Pinker’s provocative suggestion that the rise of manners at the dinner table helped bring about a <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature">steep decline</a> in violence on the streets.]</p>
<div class="article-promo-bv"></div>
<p>I asked some tasteful and civilized friends and colleagues what an updated manual for 2014 would look like. Here are 27 rules to help you, whether at an office lunch, the company gym or the birthday party of your child’s schoolmate.</p>
<p>You’ll notice a common denominator in all of them: Think about other people’s feelings first because it’s not all about maximizing your personal convenience.</p>
<p>1. Texting “Hey, I’m running 20 minutes late” is not as acceptable as making the effort to be on time.</p>
<div class="vestpocket">
<div id="vest-pocket-container" class="article-vp-wrapper ng-scope">
<div class="vp-slick-slider slick-initialized slick-slider">
<div class="slick-list draggable"></div>
<div class="knob icon icon-chevron-right"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. If you can’t attend an event that you’re formally invited to, don’t think that not RSVPing is the same as declining. And don’t RSVP at the last minute for an event that involves real planning by the host.</p>
<p>3. Show some decency around the office refrigerator: If you didn’t put the food in, don’t eat it. And take your leftovers home or throw them out before they morph into some radioactive nightmare.</p>
<p>4. Don’t bellow on your cell phone. Just because you can’t hear the other person well doesn’t mean the other person can’t hear you well.</p>
<p>5. Turn off the phone at a dinner party, and be in the moment. You’re annoying at least one person who thinks you have no social skills. At bare minimum, turn off the ringer so you can text and conspire in relative stealth.</p>
<p>6. Remember that if you feel a need to respond immediately to every incoming text, you’ll lose more in the eyes of the person who’s in front of you than you’ll gain from the unseen people who are benefiting from your efficiency.</p>
<p>7. When you get to the front of the line at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/starbucks/" target="_self">Starbucks</a>, don’t tell the barista to wait while you wrap up your phone discussion. The barista hates you, and so does everyone behind you. They are hoping the barista spits in your latte.</p>
<p>8. If you come late to an exercise class, don’t think you’re entitled to barge your way to your favorite spot in the front.  And don’t block others from weight racks or other equipment—just step back three feet and make everyone happy.</p>
<p>9. Keep personal conversations and arguments off social networking sites. The dramatic airing of grievances is best done through <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/sms/" target="_self">SMS</a>.</p>
<p>10. Moderate your use of cameras and video at events. Enjoy your time with colleagues, friends and family in the present and preserve only a memento for the future, rather than recording the entire thing to “relive” later in some “free” time that you’ll never actually have.</p>
<p>11. Remember how easily e-gossip can be forwarded along to the wrong person.</p>
<p>12. Just because you’re wearing headphones doesn’t mean you can tune out from social courtesies. For example, if you accidentally cross someone’s personal space, apologize graciously.</p>
<p>13. Don’t lend someone a book or item unless they specifically ask for it. They’re probably too busy to ever get around to it. They’ll feel guilty about that, and you’ll be annoyed that they didn’t appreciate it or even get around to returning it.</p>
<p>14. Don’t RSVP for an event, then not show. Now you’re not just being rude, but you’re costing the host money, and you’ve probably kept a lonely soul from being invited as a backup.</p>
<p>15. Don’t be the first or second person to talk on your cell phone in a public space (like a bus or train). If everyone’s doing it, you’re allowed some slack here.</p>
<p>16. Don’t show up at a party empty-handed, unless you’ve been instructed to — and sometimes not even then. Bring wine or dessert or a plant.</p>
<p>17. Use your turn signal at least 50% more than you use your middle finger.</p>
<p>18. Don’t make your dietary requirements everyone else’s dilemma. As one friend reminds me, “People who can eat dairy don’t just keep coconut oil-based butter around.”</p>
<p>19. If your children are invited to a friend’s house to play, they (and you) should also feel invited to help with the cleanup.</p>
<p>20. Don’t break up with someone by text. And don’t announce a death in the family by text. There are still times when phones or face-to-face are the best way to go.</p>
<p>21. Don’t take photos for posting on the People of Walmart page.</p>
<p>22. Don’t discuss sensitive personal issues on<a href="http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/" target="_self">Facebook</a>, especially if you’ve friended coworkers.</p>
<p>23. Your dog is cute, but he or she doesn’t have a pass to go anywhere. “I’m a huge dog lover,” says one colleague, “but don’t assume it’s okay to bring along your dog to my house. I can barely stand what my own dogs do to my house … I also don’t like people who bring their animals to Petco. Seriously, do you think your dog likes to shop? It’s just you seeking attention. You probably don’t even need anything at Petco… you’re just there because you can bring your dog in, and you think it’s cool to bring a dog out in public. Dogs don’t shop. They would rather be sniffing the pee on that trashcan outside by the front door than walking on slippery retail flooring.”</p>
<p>24. Double-check that your headphones are plugged-in before streaming your favorite Spotify station.</p>
<p>25. Don’t say, “I’m having a party. Bring your own food and drink.” That’s not a party.</p>
<p>26. If you’ve been invited to an event, be reluctant to ask for an upper ceiling on how many friends and relatives you can bring.</p>
<p>27. And finally, all the classics still apply. One working mother offers a quick review here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chew with your mouth closed; don’t talk with food in your mouth; keep your elbows off of the table while eating; wash your hands after going to the restroom. My children know better—so why do I see adults exhibiting such poor behavior? If you bump into someone, say excuse me. Don’t reach across someone’s face. Don’t board a plane when they’re loading group A and you are in group D. Don’t stay behind the crosswalk when you are making a left turn and thus prevent anyone else behind you from turning. Don’t let your kids act like wild monkeys in a restaurant. Don’t touch someone’s belly when she’s pregnant–or even when she isn’t. Don’t leave cupboard doors and drawers open—someone can get hurt. And don’t pull up to the exit gate in a parking lot without your ticket handy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That may seem like a lot, and to some it may seem like an uptight way to live. But just remember the basic success principle underlying all manners: Think about other people’s feelings first because it’s still not all about you.</p>

<p><strong>“Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we’re supposed to be and embracing who we are.” ~</strong><strong>Brené Brown</strong></p>
<p>Now that the fog of what everyone else wanted for me has lifted, it seems so clear to me that we need to be who we truly are—not what society expects us to be. But it wasn’t always this way.</p>
<p>For decades, I bought into a model of success that belonged to someone else. I was studying for my MBA, but I didn’t want my friends to think I was weird, so I didn’t reveal that I was a yogi. I didn’t want them to not take me seriously, to laugh at the thought of me doing yoga while wearing a business suit.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t tell my yoga students that I liked heavy metal because I feared it would make me look less spiritual. When was the last time you heard the Dalai Lama talk about Ozzy Osbourne?</p>
<p>I didn’t delve into the artistic sides of my spirit—the parts that painfully wanted to celebrate music, art, or poetry—because I was led to believe it was a distraction from my professional career. I was caught in a catch-22 where I couldn’t be one thing because I was another. Society would only accept me as one.</p>
<h3><strong>Reality Doesn’t Bite</strong></h3>
<p>In fact, I have seen the exact opposite. The more I practice finding, being, and expressing myself, the more prosperity I experience and the better I perform in business. Most importantly, I’m living the advice we give our kids: be yourself.</p>
<p>By finding our true selves, we can express ourselves internally and to those around us, and that’s when we become aware of this symphony. Today, we often get trapped in the little “self,” or the pain body, as <a title="The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577314808/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1577314808&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tinbud-20&amp;linkId=2WRBNOQFPZP2ML22">Eckhart Tolle</a> calls it. It’s the false mask we put on to protect ourselves and fit in with others’ expectations.</p>
<p>Connecting with our true selves is challenging—we often feel a great deal of pressure to meet societal demands of <a title="Let Go of Who You Think You Should Be and Become Who You Want to Be" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/let-go-of-who-you-think-should-be-and-become-who-you-want-to-be/">who we should be</a> or what we should look like, often in direct conflict with authenticity. Yet we have the great potential to unveil our true selves and rock the universe.</p>
<h3><strong>Break Past Societal Demands</strong></h3>
<p>Societal demands know no bounds—they impact both men and women, but they affect them in different ways.</p>
<p>I’ve found that, while self-expression is difficult for everyone, men often put up a different façade of who they think they need to be at work and home; then, they pretend that it’s not a façade. Women, on the other hand, are more aware of this façade.</p>
<p>Women are also more reluctant to express all the facets of their personalities until they’re comfortable with a group. Men will often put up a façade and stay in it longer. Women need a sense of trust to open up, which takes time. In both cases, inauthenticity can lead to dysfunction, stress, disease, and distance from your highest potential.</p>
<h3><strong>Uncover Your True Identify</strong></h3>
<p>That’s not to say that you must express all facets of who you are at all times for all people. As humans, we must <a title="Reconnect with Your Authentic Self Instead of Denying Your Feelings" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/reconnect-with-your-authentic-self-instead-of-denying-your-feelings/">be authentic</a> and true with the aspects of ourselves that we <em>do</em> express in each context. Letting only certain facets of the diamond in you shine in various settings is perfectly fine as long as it’s a facet of the true you—not a false mask.</p>
<p>Here are some actions you can take to tap into spirit by tapping into your authentic self:</p>
<h4><strong> 1. </strong><strong>Do yoga.</strong></h4>
<p>I strongly recommend Kundalini Yoga, which works at all levels—physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual. It gets you out of your head and helps you uncover your unique vibrations without letting your brain or fear take over.</p>
<h4><strong> 2.</strong><strong>Sit in silence for a few minutes.</strong></h4>
<p>I do this every day. Sit in the space of your greatness and spirit. Do nothing, chant nothing, and don’t worry about how you sit; just be. Sounds easy, right? Try it. It’s one of the hardest things for many people to do, yet it’s the most powerful way to get connected to your true source.</p>
<h4><strong> 3.</strong><strong>Self-reflect.</strong></h4>
<p>When you think, “I can’t be that way” or “What will they think?” ask yourself where this voice is coming from. Is it fear, the <a title="10 Reasons to Be Okay with Being Disliked" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/10-reasons-to-be-okay-with-being-disliked/">need to be liked</a>, or a need to fit in? Then, adjust your strategy and take a few risks. Find a way to be authentically present and engaged, and let that part of you speak, act, or even stay silent.</p>
<h4><strong> 4.</strong><strong>Put pen to paper.</strong></h4>
<p>Ask yourself for details of who you are, and write them down. Ask yourself, “Am I authentic in my expression and experience of each of these roles? What is one thing I can do to move closer to my authentic expression in each facet of who I am—my words, my appearance, and my actions?” If you journal first thing in the morning, it propels you to another whole level of self-realization.</p>
<h4><strong>5. </strong><strong>Tune out the negativity.</strong></h4>
<p>When you’re watching TV or reading a magazine or a website and you hear the message “<a title="7 Things to Remember When You Think You're Not Good Enough" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/7-things-to-remember-when-you-think-youre-not-good-enough/">you’re not good enough</a> as you are,” turn it off or simply say, “I reject that.” You’re a powerful and divine expression of spirit back to spirit—perfect and complete. The more authentic you are, the more you will know and experience this.</p>
<h4><strong> 6. </strong><strong>Take action.</strong></h4>
<p>Take one action that’s a true expression of your unique self or your unique note in the symphony of the universe. Just speak or act authentically in a small way when you’re tempted to stay quiet or pretend you’re something else, and see how it feels. Keenly observe how you feel afterward. Are you breathing deeper? Smiling more? Feeling less tense?</p>
<p>You have the potential to shape a new reality as you discover your true self. You must tune in to the incredibly unique and beautiful kaleidoscope of who you are and let it shine. Experiment a bit, especially around your closest friends and family.</p>
<p>Embrace your authentic self, and in enacting this positive change, you’ll enact a powerful change in the world around you.</p>

<p><b>“Live your life for you, not for anyone else. Don’t let the fear of being judged, rejected or disliked stop you from being yourself.</b><b>” ~</b><b>Sonya Parker</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>I have struggled with my different-ness since I was young. I grew up trying to change the things that made me different in order to fit in. At home, my parents were doing their best to raise three young children, which I can imagine would’ve been very hard.</p>
<p>I can still remember the first time I asked myself, “<a title="10 Ways I Know There's Nothing Wrong with You (or Me)" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/10-ways-i-know-theres-nothing-wrong-with-you-or-me/">What is wrong with me</a>?” I loved to take my time and have everything neat and tidy; my family, on the other hand, was the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Being neat and tidy reflected in the way I would dress myself. One morning, when I was getting ready for my first day of school, my parents gave me socks to wear that didn’t match. I got very upset, and although they tried to understand what the problem was, they couldn’t help but be frustrated with me, as I was making the morning more difficult.</p>
<p>We were also running late. I wanted to take my time and not be hurried. This caused us to run even later and made my parents even <a title="Be Stress-Free: Eliminate 5 Common Unnecessary Stressors" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/be-stress-free-eliminate-5-common-unnecessary-stressors/">more stressed</a>. I felt so guilty to have made them feel like this.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>I wanted to belong and feel loved by them, so I tried my hardest to change the things about me that seemed to cause them stress.</b></p>
<p>Trying to change these things that were a big part of who I was created inner conflict, and I would have big tantrums as a result. This would cause my parents stress as well, so eventually I stopped expressing my feelings.</p>
<p>I <a title="How to Release Shame and Love All of You" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-to-release-shame-and-love-all-of-you/">became ashamed</a> of the things that made me different. I was shy. I loved lots of time on my own. I had dark skin.</p>
<p>I wanted to be accepted to <a title="Stop Fearing Disapproval: 3 Lessons from Repeated Exposure to Judgment" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/stop-fearing-disapproval-3-lessons-repeated-exposure-judgment/">avoid judgment and rejection</a>. During school, other kids teased me for not having many friends. I felt so hurt and alone that I started a constant battle within myself to change my different-ness.</p>
<p>I forced myself to be more social. I searched for ways to change the color of my skin. I stopped giving myself the alone time I wanted. I stopped expressing how I was feeling.</p>
<p><b>This went on for the next twenty years. Since I spent my whole life trying to fit in, I never really got to know my true self. It was incredibly exhausting and I was very unhappy.</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>It took having kids to wake me up. The love I had for my two boys gave me the drive to search for another way to live.</p>
<p>I wanted my boys to love and accept themselves for who they were, differences and all, but how was I to teach them if I didn’t even know how? I needed to be the example.</p>
<p>I finally discovered some things that empowered me to embrace my differences. I was amazed at the life changing effect it had on me.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>When you embrace who you are:</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<h4><b>1. You stop living in fear.</b><b> </b></h4>
<p>The choices I make in life are no longer dependent on what other people will think, whether I will be judged, disliked, or rejected. I just focus on being me.</p>
<p>In the past, I feared what people would think of me for choosing to have a few close friends instead of a huge social circle and spending a lot of time on my own. Now that I accept that this is <i>me</i>, I feel a sense of freedom.</p>
<p>Trying to be someone you’re not is exhausting. <a title="You Are Enough: A Tiny Manual for Being Your True Self" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/you-are-enough-a-tiny-manual-for-being-your-true-self/">Being your true self</a> is a courageous thing to do in a world that is constantly trying to change you. When you realize that living the life you want is more important than pleasing other people, suddenly you feel free.</p>
<h4><b>2. You form deeper, more connected relationships</b>.</h4>
<p>In the past, I’ve had my fair share of not-so-good relationships. People would connect to the fake me, so they were never genuine relationships.</p>
<p>I was able to sift through my relationships by loving my differences and being myself. This allowed the right people to come into my life who loved the real me. My relationships are now all fulfilling and genuine.</p>
<p>If you want people to accept you for who you are, you first have to show them who that is.<b><br />
</b></p>
<h4><strong>3. You treat yourself more kindly.</strong></h4>
<p>I saw myself as weird so I would constantly put myself down and <a title="How to Stop Beating Yourself Up Over Mistakes" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-to-stop-beating-yourself-up-over-mistakes/">beat myself up</a>. The negative self-talk was painful.</p>
<p>In accepting my “weirdness,” I went from telling myself, “Because of my differences, I’m worthless and no one will ever love me,” to “I have to be true to myself. The people who really matter will accept me for who I am.”</p>
<p>It was so liberating, I started to feel the happiest I’ve ever felt.</p>
<h4><b>4. You’re better able to find your passion.</b></h4>
<p>When hiding my true self, I could never know my strengths. I’m a compassionate person, which makes me good at helping people. I found that this is what I love to do and it’s my passion.</p>
<p>After learning this about myself, I was able to offer my friends and family advice when they needed help. I branched out and started my own blog, which is my main creative outlet where I can combine my passion for writing and helping people.</p>
<p>Once you allow yourself to be who you are, you’re free to find what you’re good at and what you love to do.</p>
<h4><b>5. You start appreciating yourself.</b></h4>
<p>When you truly <a title="Dare to Be Different: Why It's Okay to Break the Mold" href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/dare-different-okay-break-mold/">embrace your differences</a>, you begin to find reasons to appreciate them. I’ve always been ashamed of my introverted nature, thinking it was a weakness. Only recently have I started to embrace it. I now appreciate that it allows me to enjoy time on my own, which is where I’m the most creative.</p>
<p>I’ve finally discovered my strengths and weaknesses. I own them and I am grateful for them both because they make me who I am.</p>
<p>When you start seeing your “weaknesses” as potential strengths, you develop a whole new sense of appreciation for yourself.</p>
<p>I hope these lessons can help you learn to embrace your differences without having to become a parent to do it—and if you are already a parent, then I hope this can inspire you so you too can pass on self-acceptance to your children.</p>
