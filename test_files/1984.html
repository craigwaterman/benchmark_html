											<div class="entry-content">
							<p>I pull off at the nearest exit after the accident. I find some kind of deserted recreation center and stop in the parking lot. My abdominal muscles tighten, so tight that it hurts and won’t release anytime soon. I clench the wheel and bang my head against the headrest again and again until I’m dizzy and I no longer know if the tears running down my face are from the accident, the weekend, or the headache I’m giving myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have to drive through Atlanta—through hell—to get back home to Alabama. I’m forgetting to breathe. I worry that I won’t be able to make it down I-20. What if I have a second accident? In the midst of a mild panic attack, other questions swarm through my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You knew this was a mistake. Why did you ask to hang out? Why did you go?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Did it even matter?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~          ~          ~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe in bridge building. I have a diversity of friends and acquaintances with different opinions. Some are more vocal than others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You just haven’t found the right woman.</em></p>
<p><em>You haven’t found the right man.</em></p>
<p><em>Don’t base your beliefs on your emotions.</em></p>
<p><em>Don’t be afraid to feel.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re too conservative. Wake up to reality.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re too liberal. Stop questioning everything.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>People have strong opinions. They will fight to have the last word. I usually give it to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a generally reticent disposition to the world around me. I am, as Addie Zierman <a href="http://addiezierman.com/2014/05/06/why-i-dont-write-about-the-hot-button-issues/">put it recently</a>, a “conscientious observer” of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The paradoxes that I’m interested in exploring aren’t the ones that make the Internet blow up. They’re the quiet, deep-down ones – the ones I find in my own messy heart: <em>kindness and cruelty. Faith and doubt. Grace and justice and redemption and forgiveness and flesh and spirit.</em>”</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>That’s the kind of guy I am most of the time. It definitely describes Seth in real life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if I choose to say, “Hey, this is my experience,” someone will question my faith. If I lay out my beating heart to the world, people will disregard it; some will say nasty things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not so easy when your very existence is controversial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do try to avoid conflict where I can. This blog isn’t the place to discuss who’s right in the gay debate. Should gay marriage receive acceptance from the church? Should the church mandate celibacy for sexual minorities? I don’t want to go there. Yes, I am a gay man and these questions shape my life, but they can also end an important dialogue. So let’s take that discussion off the table. There are other blogs and books that can address those kind of questions far better than I can. Let’s talk about what it means to be a Christian sexual minority. Let’s talk about the redemption of creation and the growth of the kingdom and how LGBTs fit into that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how we love people well with whom we disagree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~          ~          ~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas and I have been friends for more than two years. We met online and finally hung out in person once last summer as I headed back home from a friend’s wedding in Knoxville. He showed me around the little town in Georgia where he grew up. It was a fairly short meeting for driving five hours out of the way to meet him, but I didn’t care. It was nice to sit back and let Thomas open up about his past. It was nice that he cared enough to show me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tend to be the initiator in my long distance friendships. It stems from insecurity. Every friendship I’ve had with a gay man ended when I stopped talking. Admittedly, you find higher quality friendships in places other than gay dating apps, but that was a different time and I didn’t know where else to look. I desperately wanted to find people like me. A few guys talked to me out of kindness, not because they thought I was a cool dude (I mean c’mon, man. I think theology, psychology, and literature are pretty sweet). And they didn’t reciprocate interest in keeping things to “just friends” (and especially not if it excluded the benefits). Some were frankly just gross.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas wasn’t like that. He apparently saw something in me that no one else did. At least he listened and actually opened up about his life too. He probably knows more about me than any other human on this earth. I’ve told him things via texts and Facebook messages I had never told anyone else. He’s been like a brother to me. We share a birthdate and though we don’t have much in common other than our faith and sexual orientation, knowing we’ve walked the earth for the same number of days always meant a lot to the sentimentalist in me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet as a long distance friendship, Thomas was still, in a sense, a stranger to me; a blended creation of facts and pieces of conversations and the expectations of a lonely man. If I made the choice to know the real Thomas, the less my image would continue to exist. What if I liked my imaginary friend better than the real one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a dream in March that I went to Georgia to hang out with Thomas to celebrate our twenty-seventh birthday. I’m a little spontaneous sometimes, so I texted Thomas and told him we should do something for our birthday this year. So a week later he invited me to a lake house party with his boyfriend and some of his friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Oh, Sethy. What have you gotten yourself into now?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not an extrovert. My mind goes blank and I smile awkwardly and people probably think I’m stuck up. No, sir. This situation sounded like a disaster waiting to happen. Maybe this friendship wasn’t really sustainable anymore.</p>
<p>The day after our birthday, I told Thomas I wasn’t going. He asked why, and I simply replied I couldn’t do it. I was so sure I would shut down and I would get hurt. Thomas reassured me that he thought it would be a safe place to branch out, but he said ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had guaranteed I was safe. I ensured I wouldn’t get hurt. No awkward situations for me. I –oh wait a minute. My last post had something to say about this. I told my readers to take risks, lean into the tension, fall down and get back up. Shoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I texted Thomas the next day and told him I had changed my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~          ~          ~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas and I are like day and night. We may have lived the same number of days and share similar experiences, but we have made different choices. He has a boyfriend, I’m choosing celibacy as I grapple with my questions. He’s liberal, I’m moderate. He graduated from public school and a public university, I was home schooled and graduated from a Christian college. We come from different worlds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, my friendship with Thomas crosses cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christena Cleveland wrote in her beautiful book <em>Disunity in Christ</em>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“People can <em>meet </em>God within their cultural context but in order to <em>follow</em> God, they must cross into other cultures because that’s what Jesus did in the incarnation and on the cross. Discipleship is crosscultural. When we meet Jesus around people who are just like us, and then continue to follow Jesus with people who are just like us, we stifle our growth in Christ and open ourselves to a world of division. However, when we’re rubbing elbows in Christian fellowship with people who are different from us, we can learn from each other and grow more like Christ. Like iron sharpens iron.”¹</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleveland stresses crosscultural unity because we have so much to learn from each other—across ethnicities, across denominations, and I’d add across perspectives on sexual ethics. If you look at the “Side A” versus “Side B” debate, to use The Gay Christian Network’s terms, you find two groups who desire to glorify Christ and love their neighbors. Both sides have valid points and shared interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to submit to the authority of the church and work with the Christians in my life (conservative and liberal) to consider what my sexual orientation and sexual identity means for me as a follower of Jesus. It’s frustrating work, but it’s where I feel called to be. It&#8217;d probably be easy to grow distant from Thomas because of the differences in our life stories. The texts would eventually cease and we would forget each other. It would even be easy for me to latch onto a position and become more and more entrenched until I couldn’t hear Thomas speak anymore. Thomas would become one of <em>them</em>. A person I could categorize with broad, ignorant assumptions until he’s not really a complex, breathing human being—just a lifeless caricature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t want that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Cleveland primarily discusses the cultural differences between ethnic and denominational groups in her book, her message applies more broadly to all divisions within the church. Cleveland’s message offers a lot to consider on how we dialogue about sexual ethics in the church. It’s helpful for knowing how to build conversations and relationships with strong supporters of both traditional and gay marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Cleveland helps me consider how my friendship with Thomas moves forward.</p>

<p>Finding home isn’t easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve hesitantly searched for safe people to become my community. I’ve spent even more time running away from opportunities. Vulnerability requires great risk. I admire a lot of the Christian friends and acquaintances I’ve made over the years, and let’s face it. I like to be liked and I worry about rejection. I fear that most Christians wouldn’t understand (and don’t want to understand) my experience as a gay man in the body of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m perpetually stuck in a revolving door, connecting but then running when it looks like I may get hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I refused to let anyone in. I feared if I opened the door, it would slam back in my face. So I learned the art of loneliness. A line from a song in <em>The</em> <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> aptly described my youth, “Never dreamed out in the world / There are arms to hold you / You’ve always known / Your heart was on its own.” So I walked through life as a loner not really expecting to be loved. It ensured safety because no one could hurt me. But no one could know me either. I was just a guy in the background without anything to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God said it wasn’t good for man to be alone. As a loner, I withered in anxiety and depression, hating the façade I wore. But I still liked people; I liked listening to them talk and I couldn’t help opening the door occasionally throughout life. Usually, I’d become paranoid or get hurt, and then <em>I </em>would slam the door. I’d get upset and beat myself up for being stupid and oh you know, hoping someone would notice my existence and like what they saw. <em>I can handle this by myself. Get it together, man.</em> If I had seen <em>Frozen</em> back then, I would have been telling myself, <em>Conceal, don’t feel</em>. Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite all my attempts to hide, my heart refused to stay held in the dungeon of its captivity. I placed it there to keep it safe. It just wouldn’t stay put. My heart would sneak out when I wasn’t looking, when I was just trying to mind my own business. Suddenly I would have a crush out of nowhere or simply a desire to connect to someone I couldn’t help but find fascinating. And maybe I’d indulge my heart one more time, but then I’d usually freak out, and my heart would go back to the dungeon. I told it that love doesn’t work for people like us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn’t listen. Silly heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then one day in introductory psychology, it decided enough was enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>It’s time, Seth</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whoa, time for what?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Time to tell someone the truth.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Heck no! There’s no going back if I do that! They’ll think I’m some sort of monster!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But you’ll be free. Maybe you won’t have to carry this alone anymore.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I told a friend. Then my pastor. Then my psychology instructor. Then my parents and siblings. And so I began my ex-gay journey (that&#8217;s a story for another day). I had taken a sledge hammer to the walls around my heart and made the first real attempt to tear them down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~          ~          ~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tell Christian testimonies in two parts. On one hand, you have the broken, messed up, miserable excuse for a life. But you can’t have a Christian testimony without an amazing transformation finale. The Christian proclaims how God brought freedom from sin and sorrow and now everything appears happy, rosy and perfect. <em>Ain’t God great, y’all?! </em>Well, that’s not real life. Beauty forms from struggle and suffering. The Christian life isn’t an easy one. We frustrate our brothers and sisters by whitewashing the difficulty that comes after committing our lives to Christ. No one, Christian or nonchristian, receives the “get out of jail free” card when it comes to trouble and problems. God promises to walk with us and work in us through the suffering to gradually transform us into Christ’s likeness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hear coming out stories from other gay Christians, I feel a little torn. Sometimes they can feel like those cheesy, unrealistic Christian testimonies. Just come out and you will feel fantabulous. Goodbye, miserable closet life. Now, I don’t regret coming out to the extent I have so far. But gay Christians can feel pressured to gloss over the tough stuff we still face. We can trade one mask for another just like the broader Christian culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I came out to friends and family and began processing my sexuality, I would feel frustrated and a little depressed reading Christian coming out stories. It seemed like opening up had solved all their problems. But I was still insecure. I was still a little socially awkward. And I still felt very broken. In a lot of ways, I was still basically a loner afraid of meaningful, intimate friendships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming out didn’t fix any of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you spend so much of your life stifling emotions, walling up your heart, and avoiding friendships to keep a secret hidden, there will be repercussions. Psychologists call it learned helplessness. You shock a dog so many times without a way out, eventually when an escape from the pain appears, the door opens, the dog will just lie there and whimper. He has accepted the pain and no longer believes in freedom though the opportunity stands right in front of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming out is an important step, but it’s just the first step on a long, winding road. Some of my lowest days came after opening up about my sexuality to friends and family. I’ve had major depression and anxiety since starting this blog. But through the process of self-disclosure you learn resilience. You fall down, and you get back up. You find you’re tougher than you think. You learn to lean on Christ for the strength to get through the current moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But falling down still hurts. My former pastor used to say that people are like porcupines trying to snuggle up. Inevitably we&#8217;re going to poke each other. Relationships hurt sometimes. Pain is part of life. No matter how much we try to medicate it, hide from it, or delay it, pain exists. Is love worth it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis wrote,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in the casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s no easy way to become part of a community. It’s awkward. You make mistakes—sometimes embarrassing, bad mistakes. Tension always exists between safety and risk. Lean into the risk; let it burn as the flames of vulnerability engulfs the dross of your fears and insecurities. You won’t be the same, but you will be something better; someone stronger. You will be a person loved by a community in this world. It may take some time and heartache before you find it, but I believe God provides tangible reminders of His affection if we’ll seek them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I focus so much attention on my own heart and self-worth, I reveal something far more complicated and broken about myself. I’m self-centered. When I’m only worried about myself, I don’t see the situation going on around me. John Ortberg describes it as living in an antique shop:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Every day you and I walk through God’s shop. Every day we brush up against objects of incalculable worth to him. People. Every one of them carries a price tag, if only we could see it. Lepers and AIDS patients, children and gray panthers, the wise and the foolish, saints and prostitutes: Worth the life of my Son, the price tag says. Will you respect the value of those you touch? Are you willing to pay the price? When you reach out to the untouchables in your world, you are signing up for pain. Love means disappointment and heartache.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love does involve risk and occasionally it wounds our souls through the journey of life, but as C. S. Lewis pointed out, to escape the pain and loss we must abandon living and embrace Hell. To experience Heaven on Earth, we must accept that the good, beautiful moments are but a taste of what’s to come. The bitter, broken pieces also point to the truth that we’re made for a better world that’s not here yet. And in the process of <em>shalom</em>, the Hebrew word for prospering and peace, we’re ever making the Lord’s Prayer a reality; where the Lord’s will is done in Earth as it is in Heaven. As the Kingdom of God expands throughout history, it culminates with the return of Christ after all enemies have been placed under His feet, the last enemy being death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God’s kingdom expands as we push past our insecurities and self-centeredness and jump enthusiastically into community. Redemption and restoration comes through intimate, close friendships. As we build flourishing communities of love where evil is vanquished and the captives are set free, we live out the Lord’s Prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Ortberg continues his antique shop illustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…God’s shop is full of signs that say please touch. We may not want to. We are afraid or shy or busy. But it is only when people are touched in their brokenness that healing comes.”<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church, in my opinion, is the fulfillment of Revelations 22. Scripture says there are trees that produce leaves for the healing of the nations. I believe this describes the church’s work now. As we touch the lives of those around us, healing occurs and the kingdom advances. This should motivate me to love others without regard to risk and pain. This is why I should share my story with the world. Healing comes when we feel free to be vulnerable and transparent, knowing our community accepts and loves us, and values our contribution to the work of the kingdom. This is our vocation, no matter who we are or what we do. We all have a role to play in God’s redemptive narrative. And as I participate in shalom, I find a home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loner is ever learning to belong.</p>

							<p><span style="color: #000000;">God sometimes feels something like Sid from Toy Story. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A sadistic kid with evil plots for his toys.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I grew up in a denomination that emphasized God’s sovereignty over history and our salvation. God chose some through predestination to Heaven, while abandoning others to their fate in Hell.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We had proof texts like</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;For his dominion is an everlasting dominion,</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">and he does according to his will among the host of heaven</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">and among the inhabitants of the earth;</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">and none can stay his hand</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">or say to him, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217;”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">Daniel 4:34-35 ESV.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I believed in God’s absolute sovereignty without question like any good Reformed Christian. I believed scripture was black and white. God is good because He promises I can trust Him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But there came a day when I didn’t trust God. I realized at Bryan College I was never going to become straight and I didn’t have a clue what that meant for my life. It scared me. Celibacy scared me. The idea of marrying a guy scared me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I had invested all my hope in healing my sexuality. <i>I am not gay. I cannot be gay. I AM NOT GAY</i>. I just had to figure out God’s secret plan to make myself straight. I felt at home among conservative, straight Christians because I believed eventually I was going to be one of them. Beautiful wife. A couple kids. The American dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I woke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What now? The church hadn’t prepared me for this reality. I didn’t feel like God had prepared me to be gay in the church. Suddenly the safe, familiar home amid conservative, straight Christians felt foreign and threatening. Everything I believed was called into question.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Who are you, God?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C. S. Lewis wrote amid the grief of losing his wife “Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not ‘So there’s no God after all,’ but ‘So this is what God’s really like. Deceive yourself no longer.’”¹</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After college I developed friendships with other gay men. I didn’t want to freak anyone out, so I kept my new friends a secret from my family and church. Secrets kill the soul and damage relationships. I made a lot of mistakes and got hurt multiple times. But over those years I made a few friends and acquaintances I still care about. Out of a lot of men driven by lust I found a few who loved Jesus or at least had the maturity to value friendship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I found myself in a tension of old beliefs and new ideas I wanted to believe. The God I had known was one who loved the elect, not every single human being. I didn’t want to get on His bad side. How could I reconcile this image with the Jesus who came in grace and truth and hung out with sinners? But I also felt like a man looking into two storefront windows. One, the conservative Christian church; the other, the lives of my gay friends. Some of my gay friends were very dear to me. One pastor had told me that not only were gay Christians going to Hell, but they had an even worst place in Hell prepared for them because they knew the truth and used Jesus to cover their sins. That really helped my anxieties.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Could I be more righteous than God for loving those He refused to love?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Suddenly my faith fell apart. I felt that in order to be a Christian, I needed to give up my compassion. It made sense why so many evangelicals stick to their own. They have certainty that the people they love will be with them in Heaven. You don’t have to be stressed out, anxious, depressed, and angry all the time. You can coldly tell someone, <i>you’re a sinner. Repent or get the hell out of my life.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was mad at God. I could totally relate to Lewis when he wrote, “Sometimes it is hard not to say ‘God forgive God.’”² Scripture told me not to be anxious, but how can you surrender your anxiety to God when you can’t trust your Heavenly Father?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was mad at Christians. Their ignorance and lack of concern for the marginalized infuriated me. I ranted on Facebook. A lot. My friend count dropped as I offended my evangelical acquaintances. I drifted away from church. I didn’t go most Sundays, and if I did, it was only out of obligation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">God felt silent. I could only read scripture through the paradigm of my denomination and it hurt. I had questions and the answers Christians gave me were hallow. The answers closed off my spirit. If I wasn’t working or in a class, you would likely find me in bed. That’s all I had energy for those days. When awake, my mind would go back to the same questions. They repeated over and over. I preferred sleep over the migraines I gave myself worrying about others. Worrying what this all meant for my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Go to Him when your need is desperate,” Lewis wrote, “when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence.”³</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s one thing if you’re conservative and believe in complete free will. Maybe you can convince a loved one to change. But if you’re convinced that God predestines all things, then you’re powerless. If everything is preordained, why pray? God’s made His choice. Why feel? I might get attached to a Hell-bound sinner. Maybe I had chosen to be a Christian because I feared Hell more than I loved Jesus. Maybe that’s what God wanted—my fear rather than my love. I finally assumed this must be what it means to be a reprobate; incapable of accepting the harsh reality of God’s nature. I was a bad Christian. Bad, Seth. Bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So here I am today. I’m still a Christian. I’m still in love with God. And many of my questions still remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I met a new acquaintance earlier this year. He said something in a coffee shop that shifted my perspective. <i>Maybe when God leaves a question unanswered, the problem is that we’re asking the wrong question.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">C. S. Lewis came to agree with this concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“When I lay these questions before God I get no answer. But a rather special sort of ‘No answer.’ It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though He shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question. Like, ‘Peace child; you don’t understand.’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable. How many hours are there in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we ask—half our great theological and metaphysical problems—are like that.”</span><sup>4</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I lost sight of grace. I’d been drenched in Calvinism for so long, I had forgotten what grace feels like. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I believe salvation is all of God. It’s not what I do, believe, say, think, or feel. It’s what Christ accomplished and finished on the cross. It’s not of works. It doesn’t demand perfection, because I can’t meet that standard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t know exactly how grace works. Where does God’s regenerating work end and man’s freedom of will begin? I don’t know. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.” John 1:11-13 ESV. Awesome. That clears up everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I know many Christians want to have their I’s dotted and their T’s crossed, but I’ve realized if I want to have a thriving relationship with God I don’t need to have perfect doctrine. I need Jesus. I need His relationship. I need to discover Him in scripture, prayer, and community to shape me into His image. I don’t have to know everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There will always be a tension between passages like John 3:16 and Romans 9. You can choose either side and use one to interpret the other. We can get lost in debates over which perspective best glorifies God. And it’s a major issue for some Christians. It’s all scripture though. And maybe we’re supposed to wrestle with these questions. It’s nothing new for me as a gay Christian—spiritual wrestling and questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Bible is more than systematic theology. Scripture is a narrative of how God redeemed us from our depravity and brokenness. We don’t want the Bible to be a story. We want to know the basics. <i>Tell us the rules. Give us a life manual. How do we avoid Hell?</i> But the Bible is so much more. It’s His love letter. It’s our history. It’s our vision for the future. If we strip it down to doctrinal points, we lose the hope of the gospel. We lose the opportunity to know God.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lewis continued from the quotation above and wrote, “And now that I come to think of it, there’s no practical problem before me at all. I know the two great commandments, and I’d better get on with them.”</span><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My compassion is not weakness. I need it to live out God’s overarching commands. I fell in love with the people the church ostracized; the ones who may never come to the “right” conclusions. That’s real agape love. I don’t love people with an agenda. I don’t have a timetable for you to conform to my beliefs by a certain length of time. I just love people. And I love Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’ve found comfort from a passage of scripture as I’ve returned to God:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” Matthew 4:43-48.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’m thankful for this passage. If God calls me to love my enemies, what does this say of His heart? Would God call me to a higher standard than He can meet? God is the standard. I am to love my enemies because He loved His enemies. When I fear God is not good, I turn to one act, God’s substitutionary death on the cross, and it reveals something of God’s character. Rather than Sid, an immature, evil brat, I see Aslan. Fierce, dangerous, and holy. But most definitely good.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t really have a position on homosexuality. I’m not “Side A” or “Side B.” I’m a man who wants to walk alongside the church and LGBTs and get my hands dirty with love and grace. I’m not positive what God thinks on the subject. I’m not God. But as I’ve encountered my Father apart from hardcore Calvinism, I’ve found a God of mercy and compassion. He’s not so much wrathful as He is concerned with justice in a corrupt world. I have held my gay friends tightly in my fists. I had to solve the questions for them. And I finally trust God enough to let go. They’re in good hands. Whatever eternity reveals, I know my responsibility in this life. Love God. Love my neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’d better get on with that.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I can be a little needy. There’s a little boy in my soul that screams “Love me! See me! Don’t leave me!” I tend to look for validation from others rather than listening to myself, or more importantly, God. I sometimes feel like I missed out on something as a home school kid growing up in a church with only older people. If I&#8217;m honest, I feel very <i>uncool. </i>I&#8217;m quiet and slightly awkward. </span><span style="color: #000000;">I depend a lot on my gay identity, especially how it interacts with my religious faith. It defines me. My sexual orientation pinpoints my differences from other people. It gives me purpose; it helps define a core aspect of my personhood. But my world is shrinking. I’m no longer the only gay Christian person I know. I’m not all that different.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Last month The Gay Christian Network held its yearly conference in Chicago¹. A lot of gay Christians I knew were there. I told a couple of folks I was so jealous. It would have been incredible to meet a lot of the people I respect and follow in person. But I wasn&#8217;t entirely honest either. The idea of going to the conference scared me. I had a lot of obvious excuses why I couldn’t go (and they will probably not change next year for Portland—sorry guys), but nonetheless, I did not want to be there. I feared an identity crisis. The thing that defined me in Alabama would become suddenly meaningless among hundreds of gay Christians in Chicago.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rhe.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-144" alt="rhe" src="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rhe-300x263.png" width="300" height="263" /></a> <a href="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dwebb.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-145" alt="dwebb" src="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dwebb-300x261.png" width="300" height="261" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gcnconference.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-146" alt="GCN Conference" src="http://buildingbridgesinwarzones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gcnconference-300x114.png" width="300" height="114" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When I come out to compassionate and open-minded straight Christians, there is curiosity. People may see me as brave, interesting, and well, <i>cool</i>. Kyle Donn, a Christian blogger, refers to this as “<a href="http://kyledonn.com/blog/sexy-christianity">Sexy Christianity</a>,” radical faith that can be glorifying to God, but can just as easily be a way to promote ourselves. Donn writes, “This kind of Christianity is dangerously cool. And that’s the thing… It’s <em>dangerous</em>. Here and there, it’s spot on; but my fear is that it flirts with the edge and settles for the empty satisfaction of a cultural ego-trip –- thirsty to hear cool people say: ‘Wow! You’re doing great things for God!’” As I processed by thoughts for preparing and launching this blog, I realized I had made an idol out of my sexual identity. I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I was trying to cover it up with an edgy label. Being gay was my ticket to the attention and validation I crave. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If I went to the GCN conference, that would mean leveling out the playing field. I didn’t want to be around gay people who naturally exude confidence and coolness that just doesn&#8217;t come naturally for me. I didn’t want to enter a new world of cliques, striving to get the “cool kids&#8217;” attention. What a Christian attitude, right? I envisioned looking into a storefront window, seeing all the amazing activity inside and feeling unable to participate&#8211;wishing desperately I was back in Alabama instead of freezing in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If my identity centers on me, on this silly pedestal I’ve formed in my mind, it will fall over. If you didn’t notice earlier, I’m a broken guy. I’m gradually coming out publicly to encourage people (gay and straight) to live without masks. If my focus centers on pleasing others to maintain the applause, then I will only trade one façade for another. I’m going to screw up. But failure is part of growing, and abundant grace flourishes despite my clumsy attempts of reflecting God&#8217;s love.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was reminded in a phone conversation recently with another gay Christian blogger that it’s ok to recognize my own need for love and validation. I tend to vilify this yearning, fearing I won&#8217;t be able to tame it. But a balance can be found somewhere between my unhealthy neediness and isolationist individualism (the very American mindset that I can deal with my problems by myself). One person cannot meet all my needs. Husbands and wives who place all their chips on a spouse for their joy and contentment in life will be severely disappointed. We are designed to thrive in a rich, diverse community, not an isolated family unit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My concern about the conference makes me laugh now. On the one hand, I’ve had gay friends for a number of years since graduating from Bryan College. While our shared experience as sexual minorities originally drew us together, it is far from the only dynamic that makes our friendships work. One gay Christian friend in particular has been a dear brother to me for several years though we’ve only met once in person. He’s been my rock through many emotional and spiritual struggles. I don’t feel pressured to be anything but who I am when we interact. Certainly not some kind of perfect super-gay-Christian.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever this blogs leads. I hope that feeling will continue to be my framework of ministry. No mask, just Seth&#8211;but at the same time I don&#8217;t want to lose myself in a black hole of self-obsession. I don’t have to prove anything to anyone. If there are people I feel drawn to befriend but they don’t reciprocate my interest in friendship and/or connection, that’s fine. God will provide for my emotional needs. If I’m seen as cool for ministering to LGBTs as an openly gay Christian man myself, great. More props to God. If people ignore or hate me for what I have to say, then this is still worth doing. The truly cool people in this world are the ones who seek to humble their hearts, slay their pride, and love without worry of how they’re perceived by their peers. That’s the kind of man I want to be.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;They said oh, we could love you</p>
<p>But we are not yet what you want</p>
<p>Because oh, anyone could love you</p>
<p>You’ve got to find where you belong&#8221;</p>
<p>-A Fine Frenzy, <i>Riversong</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Gay. It’s a loaded word. As it registers in your brain, chemical reactions instantaneously fire in your body. An emotion or a flurry of emotions tie directly to this word. You have your own emotional definition<i>. </i>Depending on what you believe and what you have experienced in your journey of life, you will have a unique subjective reaction. Words convey meaning.</p>
<p>I try to be mindful of the power of language when I express myself as gay. It’s a word that needs to be modified when used among conservative Christians. Justin Lee from the Gay Christian Network explained this so well in this video that was recently published on GCN: <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Fpdsdk6J00E?rel=0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
Christians and society are not speaking the same language. For the world outside the church, “gay” means attraction to the same sex. It says nothing of one’s actual sexual behaviors or beliefs about gay sex. The church is frankly using an antiquated definition that damages the ongoing discussion of sexual ethics and same-sex attraction.</p>
<p>Even if we can agree on a common definition for the word “gay,” the issue still remains that the conservative church feels uneasy about Christians choosing to identify with their sexual orientation. Aren’t we more than our attractions and feelings? I certainly hope so! I want to ensure that each piece of my identity carries its own weight in forming my personhood, especially my identity as a Christian. In other words, the fact that I am a man, a son, a brother, a friend, a Caucasian, an Alabamian, an Auburn football fan (War Eagle!), a lover of literature, indie music (etc.), all play important roles in defining me who I am. The pieces come with different privileges and disadvantages in society and/or the church. Saying that I am a sexual minority doesn’t trump the rest of who I am, but it does say something monumental about how I relate to both men and women. It impacts how I make choices that impact my life.</p>
<p>Until last year, I didn’t express my sexual orientation with language. I thought it was weakness to label myself with words. People can have power over you when you reduce a complex life experience to a single syllable. You can&#8217;t control how other people react, nor their preconceived beliefs and prejudices. In addition, during most of my early twenties I wanted to know I was different. I wasn’t one of <i>them</i>. But as time passed, the gospel changed my heart. I realized this ridiculous “us versus them” dualism was wrong. I developed friendships with gay people. And then something amazing happened: I realized these people were my people, just as Christians are my people. We had gone through similar struggles, similar pain. I resonated with their stories. I felt at home. I no longer needed to distance myself from <i>them</i>, because I had been one of them all long, separated only by language.</p>
<p>By expressing <em>part</em> of my identity as gay, I am declaring something far greater than sex. My identity as a gay man is a relational construct, not a sexual one. I choose to express my experience as a sexual minority in solidarity with my brothers and sisters in the gay community, especially those who share my love for Jesus. As for the term &#8220;gay Christian,&#8221; Brent Bailey from <a href="http://oddmanout.net/">Odd Man Out</a> offers this helpful note while discussing an article by Wes Hill:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think Wes or many other gay Christians, regardless of their theology, would <em>primarily</em> identify themselves as a “gay Christian” instead of just a “Christian,” as if “gay Christian” were some new category of person or “Gay Christianity” were a distinct branch of practice. I know that’s the case for me: Only rarely will I actually say the phrase “gay Christian,” since in most cases I’m either talking about myself as Christian or as a gay person. The phrase “gay Christian” is merely a means of suggesting the two realities aren’t mutually exclusive.”¹</p></blockquote>
<p>So by articulating my experience as a gay Christian man, I&#8217;m using language to express my unique needs and concerns in the body of Christ. It clarifies how I&#8217;m different from heterosexual Christians, offering a framework to help assist the majority in the church recognize the existence and struggles of LGBTs in their own congregations, families, and workplaces. While we have differences, I&#8217;m still a Christian with more in common with my straight brother and sisters in Christ than what makes us different. Maybe it helps to frame it like the differences between Caucasian, African-American, or Hispanic Christians. Hopefully by dialoguing about LGBTQ concerns, the church can begin to wrap their minds around the experience of thousands of Christians like myself. It’s a starting point that will evolve as we have the willingness to listen and minister.</p>
<p>If you still don’t like the word “gay,” that’s fine. I think Christians are trying to redeem the word and as Andrew Marin says, “elevate the conversation.” But I do understand your hesitancy. All the same, words like <i>sexual minority</i> and <i>LGBTQ</i> are being used whether the church likes it or not. Please don’t let semantics be a stumbling block for the continuation of the discussion. Agree to disagree and keep the relationship going.</p>
<p>The winding journey I&#8217;ve taken these past 26 years have led me to different places in how I frame my identity. I still have a long way to go. But through the loneliness, isolation, and frustration, I have found where I belong. It&#8217;s somewhere between the church I grew up in and LGBTQ community that calls me to be God&#8217;s (imperfect) representative. Some days it feels like no man&#8217;s land, but there are other days that I see good happening; I see shalom flourishing. I have two families who don&#8217;t get along, but I love both of them. And I intend to give my life in ministry, doing my part in mediating this conflict.</p>

							<h6 style="text-align: center;"> <em>photo by Krist Adams at creationswap</em></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">My name is Seth. And I have no idea how to begin this introduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have lived my entire life in a war ravaged country.  I didn’t grow up in the chaos of the Middle East or Africa, but in the state of Alabama in the heart of the Bible belt and SEC football. I was born into the sub-subculture of a Christian denomination with an incredibly unfortunate name (fingers crossed, but that&#8217;s probably not changing in my lifetime&#8230;). I viewed the world around me from a sheltered lens. My parents home schooled me from first grade to my high school graduation. We went to a small church filled with mostly older members&#8211;I didn&#8217;t really have a friend beside my four younger siblings until I was in my late teens. I lived in a bubble. But eventually puberty hit and changed everything I knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I suddenly felt attraction toward other guys. I had never heard this narrative. I never knew it was possible for a guy to feels things for another guy. I had never comprehended words like <i>homosexuality </i>or <i>gay</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">God wove through the first threads of my memories, a relationship as real as my parents. I came to know Him through Bible stories, A capella hymns, and sovereign grace sermons-my head lying against soft, but firm upholstered pews as the preacher spoke about words that glided over my comprehension. Or I would draw with Crayons, listening and imagining. I would sometimes pretend to preach sermons about Noah and Jesus to my stuffed animals, all lined up in their invisible pews. I publicly became a Christian when I was six years old. I walked down the aisle at the preacher’s invitation with my four year old sister. We told the church we believed in Jesus and wanted to become members of the church. I was so innocent and oblivious. That six-year-old little boy had no clue the struggle he would experience years later. He would come to learn about shame, secrets, and isolation. He would come to know the monsters of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have now lived more years post-puberty than before my experience with same-sex attraction. The journey has been long and painful. But there have been moments of beauty revealing God’s faithfulness and unfailing, tender compassion. I am often asked why I am still a Christian through everything I have endured. I often feel like Peter when Jesus asked the apostles if they too would leave Him like the multitudes who couldn’t bear his difficult teachings. Peter replied, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68). My experience with God and the church has been tumultuous, broken, and bitter. I have been hurt and hurt others. And while scripture often feels like a bazooka that preachers wield to intimidate and shame, there are many times I’m reminded that this ancient text is God’s love letter to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So yes, I am a gay man. I am also a devout Christian. When I place these two identity labels side-by-side, I feel defensive. I feel the need to prove my faith as if this were a courtroom. Some will say I lost faith in God’s miraculous abilities. Others who have heard about ex-gay or reparative therapy may think I gave up too soon. I&#8217;m not saying either are necessarily wrong, but my attempt through this blog is to be open about my faith journey. This is where I’m at. This is an invitation for you to walk with me through the questions, through the loneliness, through the grief, but also through incandescent joy and persevering hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t know where this will lead. This may be a major flop. But I have lived so much of my life invisible and silent.  It’s time to be brave. It’s time to take a risk, to dream. If I fail, I fail a stronger man than I was before.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I stand in a battlefield that has been raging long before I was born. I&#8217;m building bridges. I’m indebted to Andrew Marin for this imagery. He refers to it a lot in his work at the Marin Foundation, a peace-making organization that works with LGBTs and the conservative church. If you asked him, I know he would agree that when you build in the middle of a vehement ideological war, you will get shot sometimes. I anticipate tough criticism. I expect people will doubt my faith. But if I can help a gay teenager find hope in her despair, if I can help a straight Christian learn how to love his buddy who has just shook his paradigm, it will all be worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So regardless where you stand, I&#8217;ll close with this thought from Sarah Bessey:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #000000;">“Let’s sit here in hard truth and easy beauty, in the tensions of the Now and Not Yet of the Kingdom of God, and let us discover how we can disagree beautifully.”¹</span></p>
