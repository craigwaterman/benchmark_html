<div class="art-postcontent">
<div class="art-article"><p>THINK you are paying too much for fuel?</p>
<p>Spare a thought for those relying on diesel.</p>
<p>Truck  drivers and motorists using diesel are also suffering the city-country  price discrepancy, with the RACV estimating retail diesel prices are  about 20 cents a litre higher than wholesale.</p>
<p>For Border transport companies, that can add up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Matt  Willis, a driver for Wodonga’s D&amp;M Transport, yesterday filled up  at the Caltex in Melbourne Road for 128.9 cents a litre.</p>
<p>For an 1100-litre truck that needs filling up twice a week, that’s more than $2800 right there.</p>
<p>Mr Willis said diesel prices had dropped, but there was often a discrepancy of five cents between the city and country.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge cost in operating a truck,” he said.</p>
<p>“For  the trucks running to the capital cities regularly though, they can  save a bit when they fill up there, but you want to support your locals  as well.”</p>
<div id="mrec-story-bottom" class="aside noborder">
<div class="box-content advertisement clear"><a class="news-place-ad-info" href="http://www.bordermail.com.au/advertise/">See your ad here</a></div>
</div>
<p>Mr Willis estimated the recent price drop would save a company running four trucks between $8000 and $10,000 a month.</p>
<p>But RACV manager of vehicle engineering Michael Case said the savings could — and should — be even greater.</p>
<p>“The current wholesale price for diesel is 106.2 cents per litre and the price is continuing to drop,” he said.</p>
<p>“These prices are more than 20 cents higher than the wholesale price. This huge price difference cannot be justified.</p>
<p>“Frankly, diesel drivers in Melbourne and especially regional Victoria are being ripped off.”</p>
<p>Mr Case said the price at the pump should be at least 10 cents a litre less.</p>

<p><strong> THE driver whose truck got stuck in Galston Gorge yesterday ignored the warnings of his passenger and other motorists. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Ku-ring-gai Local Area Command crime prevention officer Paul Cleary  said other road users were again inconvenienced by a “rogue truck  driver”.</p>
<p>“Despite protests from his passenger that the truck was  over length and won’t make it and the fact car drivers behind him were  frantically flashing headlights and beeping him, the driver went for it  and lost,” he said.</p>
<p>The length of the truck was 11.2m, which is way over the length restriction in the gorge of 7.5m.</p>
<p>The driver was fined $2142 and has lost six demerit points. The truck’s registration has also been cancelled.</p>
<p>The  latest incident follows a number of other problems with oversized  vehicles getting stuck in the gorge last year, including a number of  trucks, a bus and a car towing a caravan.</p>

<h2 class="art-postheader">Truckie death in WA heat not suspicious</h2>
<div class="art-postcontent">
<div class="art-article"><div class="story-body span6">A 39-year-old truck driver was found dead after he left his bogged truck in extreme outback heat last week.
<p>The West Australian has reported that WA Police are investigating the  death of the Perth man after his body was was found about 100km North  West of Meekatharra.</p>
<p>It is believed the man's truck became bogged on Friday while he was delivering goods to a remote station.</p>
<p>Police say he left the truck and walked several kilometres in extreme  heat to look for help and then may have attempted to go back to his  truck.</p>
<p>"As the truck was late to arrive, police were informed and contact was  made with a number of remote stations to see if they had any information  regarding his whereabouts," a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>A station worker found his body.</p>
<p>Police have advised any one in a similar circumstance to stay with their vehicle.</p>
<p>It was the second outback death in two weeks, a 60-year-old man died in  the Goldfields when his vehicle broke down on the Gunbarrel hwy.</p>

<p>The Transport Workers Union (TWU) says a truck driver who became  stranded on a roadside in remote Western Australia and died could have  been saved if he’d been carrying more appropriate communications  equipment.</p>
<p>Clayton Miller was found dead about 20km from his bogged truck last week.</p>
<p>He had been delivering tanks to a remote station in the state’s north-west and died searching for help in 46-degree heat.</p>
<p>TWU assistant secretary for WA Paul Aslan says current laws require  employers to supply lone workers with "up-to-date" means of  communication for use in emergency situations.</p>
<p>He has urged law makers to specify satellite phones be carried for  all remote areas journeys, along with emergency position indicating  radio beacons [EPIRBs].</p>
<p>"There’s absolutely no doubt this man would be alive today if he had been carrying those devices," he says.</p>
<p>The satellite phone allows for real time communication with emergency  services while an EPIRB offers a more reliable positioning service than  standard global positioning devices. Both devices have become much  cheaper in recent years.</p>
<p>WA Police has reiterated the importance of staying with the vehicle when trapped in remote areas.</p>
<p>"If people end up in this type of predicament we advise them to try  not to panic, and stay with their vehicle at all times," it says.</p>
<p>"It is much easier for searchers to spot a vehicle from the air, than it is a person."</p>

<p><span>RECOGNITION:  Juanita Johnson has been nominated for the Heritage Volunteer of the  Year award for her work with the Lights on the Hill organisation.</span></p>
<p>A TRAGIC accident seven years ago changed the direction of Juanita Johnson's life forever.</p>
<p>In January, 2008, her 11-year-old son and his father were tragically  killed in a head-on truck crash after the driver of the other vehicle  fell asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p>That year, she attended the Lights on the Hill Trucking Memorial convoy  where the names of her loved ones were added to the memorial wall.</p>
<p>The mourning mother soon realised she wanted to give back to the community and use her losses to help others.</p>
<p>A beauty therapist by trade, she began studying as a nurse at the  University of Southern Queensland and now specialises in the palliative  cancer ward at the Toowoomba Hospital.</p>
<p>She also started volunteering for the Lights on the Hill organisation,  soon becoming the treasurer and then the secretary of the committee.</p>
<p>Ms Johnson's tireless fundraising efforts and work to honour and raise  awareness for our truckies led to her nomination for the Heritage Bank  Volunteer of the Year Award.</p>
<p>But the mother and grandmother is more interested in those she helps than recognition.</p>
<p>"It's very humbling, but I just do it to try and help save a life. More  than 600 truck drivers are killed on Australian roads every year. If  that was any other industry, there would be investigations, but nothing  is being done to improve what's going on," she said.</p>
<p>"You cannot downland bread and milk - everything at some stage has been on a truck.</p>
<p>"It's a very difficult job and they can see very difficult things.  They're often the first at a fatal and don't get counselling.</p>
<p>"People need to realise although it's a big vehicle; it's a human behind the wheel with a family they want to get home to."</p>

<p>A MAN died after a crash on the Western Freeway west of Burrumbeet.</p>
<p>The  collision between a sheep truck and a silver hatchback occurred west of  the intersection of Kayleys Road near Brewster about 11.10am on  Thursday.</p>
<p>A 64-year-old Melbourne man died at the scene.</p>
<p>Ballarat  Highway Patrol Senior Sergeant Pat Cleary said the 26-year-old truck  driver was taken to Ballarat Base Hospital for observation.</p>
<p>“This  is a real reminder to just be careful on the road and drive  accordingly, drive to the conditions and drive safely ... everyone needs  to be careful,” he said.</p>
<p>At least 20 sheep were killed in the collision in which the truck rolled over.</p>
<p>Traffic banked up as emergency services dealt with the wreckage and runaway sheep.</p>
<p>Police are investigating the crash and have appealed for witnesses.</p>

<p><span>Peter Hansen.</span></p>
<p>&gt;CAR and truck horns from the Peak Downs Hwy occasionally interrupted  the solemn tone at Hans Peter Hansen's funeral at Walkerston Cemetery.</p>
<p>The beloved truckie was laid to rest amid glowing tributes to his character, work ethic and friendliness.</p>
<p>The passers-by were tooting their horns to acknowledge the service, held yesterday from 10am.</p>
<p>"He'd give you the shirt off his back," a work colleague emphasised while delivering a speech.</p>
<p>"Every day, he lifted those around him."</p>
<p>Dressed in black, friends and family paid their final respects to the man affectionately known as "Old Fella".</p>
<p>But it was Mr Hansen's buoyant spirit that many spoke of - never  shirking a hard day's work and always there to help friends and family.</p>
<p>Finally at rest, Mr Hansen was farewelled with a fishing rod on his coffin. He was a keen fisherman and camper.</p>
<p>Mr Hansen was also remembered as a man who loved his daughter, Rachael, her partner and his grandchildren.</p>
<p>Well-known in truck driving circles, Mr Hansen worked across the country in various roles.</p>
<p>Born in Brisbane, he moved to Maleny at 14, and worked on a dairy farm, among other jobs.</p>
<p>His career would take him throughout Australia where his "no frills" attitude earned him many friends.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, he worked for JAT Refrigerated Road Services.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Mr Hansen's death weighed heavily on mourners'  minds but it didn't stem their glowing praise for the 72-year-old.</p>
<p>His death not only touched friends and family, it also shocked the Mackay community.</p>
<p>Mr Hansen died on December 14 following an alleged assault the previous day.</p>
<p>An 18-year-old man has been charged with murder over his death.</p>

<p class="article-abstract">A call for truckies from any state to  master a tricky South Australian freeway descent before they can get a  licence is impractical, the industry says.</p>
<p>SA deputy  coroner Anthony Schapel on Monday made a string of recommendations in  his findings into the deaths of two truck drivers in separate crashes at  the bottom of Adelaide's South Eastern Freeway.</p>
<p>The  coroner recommended that no heavy vehicle licence be issued to any  person unless they have demonstrated they can safely negotiate the  freeway descent in the presence of a trained instructor.</p>
<p>"These  requirements should apply not only to licensing regimes in South  Australia, but should be a requirement that is also imposed on  interstate drivers," he said.</p>
<p>South Australian Road Transport Association director Steve Shearer says the idea is unworkable.</p>
<p>"We  have always supported the notion of appropriate training in hills, but  what do you do to the career prospects of somebody who works on the west  coast," he told reporters.</p>
<p>"They're never going to  come to Adelaide. They drive in a dead flat environment and always will.  These things sound simple but they're not all simple."</p>
<p>The industry group broadly supported the coroner's recommendations but some would be difficult to implement, Mr Shearer said.</p>
<p>The  coroner recommended that heavy vehicle drivers negotiating the freeway  descent for the first time be accompanied and supervised by a trained  and experienced driver.</p>
<p>Interstate drivers should be  required to have "a certificate of demonstrated competence" and to  maintain a log in relation to all descents on the freeway.</p>
<p>He  also called for an increase in penalties to include prison terms for  drivers who do not use arrester beds when their truck is out of control  or who do not use the correct gear.</p>
<p>The coroner  delivered the recommendations in his findings into the deaths of truck  drivers John Posnakidis and James William Venning.</p>
<p>Mr Posnakidis, 42, died in October 2010, while waiting at a bus stop for assistance.</p>
<p>He  was killed when an out-of-control semi-trailer, driven by a Victorian  truckie, hurtled down the freeway and hit him near the same  intersection.</p>
<p>Mr Venning, 41, died in January 2014 when he crashed into a wall at the major intersection at the beginning of the freeway.</p>
<p>Transport  Minister Stephen Mullighan said the government supported the  recommendations and was already in the process of implementing some  suggestions.</p>

<p><strong> A STAGGERING 80 truck drivers have been booked for speeding on  Warringah Rd since October’s horror crash that injured six people at Dee  Why. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Yesterday highway patrol officers booked another four truck drivers for speeding down the hill where the speed limit is 20km/h.</p>
<p>This included a P-plater driving an unregistered vehicle who had his licence immediately suspended.</p>
<p>The  driver was one of two allegedly travelling 30km/h over the speed limit,  while another was 20km/h over and another 10km/h over.</p>

<p>On October 21, an out-of-control truck careered down  Warringah Rd and crossed the median strip on to the wrong side of  Pittwater Rd as it tried to turn north. It crashed into eight cars.</p>
<p>Driver  Sam Nisan, 40, of Smithfield, has since been charged with two counts of  dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and one count of  negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.</p>
<p>He is due to face Manly Court on Monday.</p>
<p>Northern Beaches  Highway Patrol Sgt Matthew Paterson said police did speed checks at the  site several times a week and it was common to book four or five truck  drivers each time.</p>
<p>“It’s not unusual but it is disappointing, given the signage and the publicity surrounding the truck crash,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s why we’ll continue our speed enforcement operations there.”</p>

<div class="story-intro">
<p><strong> A GARBAGE truck caught fire in Seaford this morning, forcing the  driver to offload a huge pile of rubbish in a hotel car park. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Firefighters praised the male driver of the SITA Australia vehicle  for his quick thinking after he saw smoke billowing from the back of his  truck about 8am.</p>
<p>He was driving along Frankston-Dandenong Rd and pulled into the Seaford Hotel carpark.</p>
<p>As per company procedure, the driver quickly looked for a safe place to park and a large space to dump the burning rubbish.</p>
<p>Two  units and six firefighters from Frankston Fire Brigade attended the  scene at 8.26am and extinguished the blaze shortly before 9am.</p>
<p>Frankston Fire Brigade senior station officer Paul Anderton said it was not uncommon for a fire to start inside a pile of trash.</p>
<p>“It overheated which caused spontaneous combustion,’’ the officer said.</p>
<p>“The driver handled it well and did a great job choosing a suitable spot to dump the rubbish.’’</p>
<p>SITA Australia spokesman Luke Schepen said a fire can sometimes occur if smouldering waste is collected.</p>
<p>“There  were no injuries or damage to property and the waste is in the process  of being collected and will be disposed of appropriately,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Mr Schepen said the company would review the incident.</p>

<h2 class="art-postheader">Northern Territory trucking companies welcome cheaper diesel, but no relief for aviation industry</h2>
<div class="art-postcontent">
<div class="art-article"><div class="inline-content photo full"><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-22/nt-fuel-prices-and-businesses/6033856"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/204644-3x2-700x467.jpg" border="0" alt="A road train transports cattle out of a livestock export yard in Noonamah" title="A road train transports cattle out of a livestock export yard in Noonamah" width="312" height="208" /></a></div>
<p class="first">The Northern Territory transport industry has welcomed lower diesel costs, but the aviation industry has missed out.</p>
<p>The average price of diesel in the Northern Territory has dropped by  about 34 cents since October last year to a current price of about $1.41  per litre.</p>
<p>When fuel costs were high Darwin based trucking  company Road Trains of Australia introduced an extra charge on  customers, called a fuel levy.</p>
<p>This month it dropped its fuel levy that it has been charging customers since 2009.</p>
<p>Mark  Castagna, operations manager for Tanami Transport, a livestock carrier  that operates out of Alice Springs, said when fuel prices were at their  peak, diesel made up around two thirds of the company's running costs.</p>
<p>"When you've got a road train that does 850 metres to the litre, it hurts alright," Mr Castagna said.</p>
<p>Tanami Transport is yet to lower its rates due to the lack of work for livestock carriers during the wet season.</p>
<p>But Mr Castagna said he might reassess that.</p>
<p>"The fuel may have dropped but everything else hasn't dropped, like tyres and spare parts," he said.</p>
<p>"So you've got to look at everything, not just the fuel, but definitely the fuel will make a difference."</p>
<h2>Aviation fuel costs remain high</h2>
<p>Lower diesel prices have not translated into lower costs for aviation fuel, avgas.</p>
<p>Katherine Aviation general manager Kerrie Mott said she has not seen a significant price decrease.</p>
<p>"From  our perspective, nothing has been passed on to us in any significant  format and, until that is the case, we can't forward any savings on to  our customers," she said.</p>
<p>Katherine Aviation purchases avgas for their remote area bases like Groote Eylandt, Borroloola and Kalkaringi.</p>
<p>"You  can only really get fuel to [the remote bases] in the dry season,  usually the last delivery you can get out is in October," Ms Mott said.</p>
<p>"After the last wet season it was June before we could get significant quantities of bulk fuel to our bases.</p>
<p>"Once  the remote fuel is utilised, and we bring in a new shipment of fuel,  then we may see a significant drop, but until that happens we are  business as usual."</p>

<h2 class="art-postheader">West Melbourne truck curfews in place next week</h2>
<div class="art-postcontent">
<div class="art-article"><p class="leadpara"><strong>New restrictions for trucks in Footscray and Yarraville will apply from the beginning of the new school year.</strong></p>
<p>New, extended truck curfews in residential areas of Melbourne’s inner-west will apply from Thursday, January 29.</p>
<p>Those ignoring the new rules will run the risk of an on-the-spot fine of $148.</p>
<p>VicRoads says the curfews restricting truck access to Moore Street  and Somerville Road in Yarraville and Footscray "strike a balance for  the local community and local truck operators".</p>
<p>"The curfews will see a reduction of trucks using local streets and  address community concerns around safety, noise and air quality,"  VicRoads says.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the beginning of the new school year, the curfews  mean heavy vehicles will be unable to access Moore Street between 8pm  and 6am weeknights, and over the weekend from 1pm Saturdays until 6am  Mondays.</p>
<p>The existing curfew on Somerville Road will be extended to add school  drop-off and pick-up times to the times trucks will be excluded. In  addition to the same hours as the Moore Street curfew, trucks will be  banned on Somerville Road between 8am and 9.30am, and from 2.30pm to 4pm  Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Exemptions will be granted to transport vehicles servicing local businesses.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vta.com.au/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=O38IhAA0KRk%3d&amp;tabid=1025&amp;language=en-AU" target="_blank"><strong>Victorian Transport Association</strong></a> says this concession was hard-fought for, and it is important that the industry abides by the curfew arrangements.</p>
<p>"As an industry, we need to ensure that compliance to the exemptions  is of the highest level and [in] doing so demonstrate the importance of  maintaining access while still accepting the concerns of the community,"  the VTA says.</p>
<p>VicRoads will host an information session* for transport operators and other affected businesses tomorrow.</p>

<div class="inline-content photo full"><strong>A truck carrying beer kegs has collided with a tram at Parkville, in Melbourne's inner north, pushing it off the tracks.</strong></div>
<div class="inline-content photo full"></div>
<div class="inline-content photo full">Two people were injured in the crash which happened on Elliot Avenue just after 11:30am on Wednesday.
<p>Paramedic Craig Cain said it was lucky the 20 people on board the tram were not seriously injured.</p>
<p>"Paramedics arrived to find the tram extensively damaged and beer kegs from the truck strewn across the road," Mr Cain said.</p>
<p>"Paramedics assessed those at the scene and no-one was seriously hurt."</p>
<p>The tram driver, who suffered cuts to the legs, was taken to the Western Hospital Footscray.</p>
<p>A female passenger, aged in her 40s, was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in a stable condition with neck injuries.</p>
<p>The truck driver was not hurt.</p>
<p>Sean Rhodes from the Metropolitan Fire Brigade said it was too early to say what caused the collision.</p>
<p>"That  will be the responsibility of investigators and Victoria Police after  they're able to have discussions with both drivers," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Rhodes said the brewery that owns the kegs was at the scene ready to recover its property.</p>
<p>"Once Victoria Police has deemed the scene safe, they'll go about the recovery of that," he said.</p>
<p>Police want to speak to anyone who saw the collision.</p>

<div class="art-article"><p>Firefighters who were injured during a rescue at a truck rollover and  ammonium nitrate explosion last year will receive bravery awards for  their selfless efforts.</p>
<p>Lieutenants Jake Sullivan and Peter Hackwood will receive the  Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner’s Medal for Valour,  and Nathan Thompson and Clinten McCarthy will receive the Commissioner’s  Commendation for Bravery Award, at a ceremony on Monday next week.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/ammonium-nitrate-truck-explodes">truck carrying ammonium nitrate</a> rolled over near Charleville, Queensland in September last year, an  accident which was attended by two fire crews who put themselves at risk  to rescue the driver despite knowing the explosive risk of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The truck exploded while firefighters tried to resuscitate the driver at the roadside.</p>
<p>The explosion was so severe it blew a crater five meters wide in the  highway, and demolished the the nearby road and rail bridges.</p>
<p>Eight people were injured, including the truck driver, two bystanders, four firefighters and a police officer.</p>
<p>Fire communications officers Leigh Murphy and James Harris will also  receive Commissioner's Unit Citations for extraordinary professionalism  during the incident.</p>

<div class="art-postcontent">
<div class="art-article"><p><strong>A TRUCK driver claimed he “forgot”  about a swag of performance-enhancing steroids in his possession when he  was arrested – and told the NT Supreme Court a shonky tale about how he  got them. </strong></p>
<p>Steven Robert Turner, 42, was charged after police found  testosterone – including a traffickable amount of Stanozolol – during a  search of his vehicle in April 2012.</p>
<p>The court heard the not-so-brilliant Crown case became stronger when Turner gave prosecutors some written ­material.</p>
<p>In  sentencing, Chief Justice Trevor Riley did not go into detail on  Turner’s explanation about where the steroids came from but said: “I do  not accept it.”</p>
<p>Turner waited eight months after the offence to  receive his court summons – a bureaucratic delay that was  “unacceptable”, Chief Justice Riley said. “But there has been further  delay ... contributed to by your own actions,” he said.</p>
<p>Turner was sentenced to one month behind bars suspended on an 18 months bond, and fined a total of $1000.</p>
