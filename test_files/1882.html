				</h2>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
						<p class="p1">Originally, I was going to put 24 things, but then you and I would be here all day, reading my rambles and personal findings or you getting bored halfway through and move onto something else. So, I summed it up and trimmed it down to 14&#8211;just trying to keep it peachy keen, here. I&#8217;m also working on that not being so wordy thing, but that&#8217;s quite the process for me. <em>(Someday, someday!)</em></p>
<p class="p1">I recently had a birthday and turned a quarter of a century old. Oomph. Halfway to 30, but I can still call myself a 20-something, so that&#8217;s alright (I CAN BE TRENDY STILL! YAY!). I think that as we grow up, we learn lessons but often times we find ourselves in situations where we are revisiting the lesson. These are a majority of the lessons that I&#8217;ve actually learned&#8211;<em>and relearned</em>&#8211;but have FINALLY put into practice. Not getting my point? It&#8217;s okay, most don&#8217;t. When I say putting a lesson learned into practice (finally), it&#8217;s kind of like this: you know that if you eat that brownie and drink most of the wine, you&#8217;re going to feel shitty the next day. But you do it anyway because in that moment, you truly think you want to. Essentially, these are 14 lessons that I&#8217;ve already learned and was aware of but now am finally putting into practice because it&#8217;s good for me both long and short term, not necessarily because I want to. (As for the brownies, I just try to avoid those altogether, but some days, you just really want a damn brownie. And that&#8217;s okay. Just make sure it&#8217;s not everyday. And also make sure it&#8217;s a good brownie, because if you&#8217;re going to have one, might as well make it worth your while!)</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Accepting adulthood</strong> (i.e. finding your ideal career, finances, etc.)<strong> is hard.</strong> You have bills to pay. Your parents will not always be there to support you when times are rough. You have to plan ahead, whether you like it or not, so that you can get yourself to be where you want to be and not stay where you&#8217;re currently at if you&#8217;re unhappy.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Stress does not aid you in finding or creating solutions when problems arise.</strong> If anything, it only makes matters worse. As Natalie Goldberg perfectly put it, <em>&#8220;Stress is an ignorant state. It believes that everything is an emergency.&#8221;</em> Not every problem that arises is a life or death situation. You will deal and you will survive while continuing to kick ass like you always do.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Your friends and family are important.</strong> They enrich your life with love and acceptance, feelings that don&#8217;t come by easily. You will always have errands to run, chores to do, litter boxes to clean (in my case at least), but when you&#8217;re old and grey (or in my case, when I go grey, I probably will just dye my hair some random color &#8211; like purple. Why not?), you&#8217;re not going to be bragging to your bingo night partners over tea and be all like, &#8220;<em>oh god, I am so glad that my focus in life was solely on work and/or school. I certainly don&#8217;t mind that I missed out on spending time with my family and friends. Amusement parks, late night laughs, holidays, festivals, movie nights, impromptu accordion sessions? Who cares? Blah!&#8221;</em> Thing is, if you continue to cancel plans or fail to put forth some effort into your relationships, you may not have any friends or family for very long. You can buy Netflix, but you can&#8217;t buy relationships that make your life worth living. Okay, a slightly dramatic comparison, but you catch my drift.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>You will remain where you are currently at if you continue to make the same decisions.</strong> This may sound obvious, but old habits, whether they&#8217;re related to health and wellness, work, or whatever, die hard. It took a lot of analyzing of myself to realize that I&#8217;d continue to be unhappy if I kept doing the same shit everyday. As Albert Einstein once said, &#8220;Insanity [is] doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&#8221;. Apparently working out 5-6 days a week but being a mild alcoholic in my late teens/early 20&#8217;s was not going to make me feel better mentally nor aid me in my physical health endeavours. Again, this seems obvious, but acknowledging your shortcomings is hard. Making change and sticking to the changes is even harder.</li>
<li class="li1">Noting that…<strong> Every decision </strong>you make will pave the road to your future. EACH AND EVERY ONE. I.e., buying a bag of organic produce versus shit-infested produce. Each time I buy organic, this is an additional expense. That extra money spent on organic produce, over time, could have been extra money in my savings account.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Each decision you make should</strong> <strong>benefit you in some way (but not at the expense of others).</strong> So, for the last one, yes, I buy organic produce 95% of the time I&#8217;d say. Sure, this means less money for me, but it also means that my innards are thankful. My environmental studies instructor once told me that every dollar is a vote. I can vote for Monsanto or my local farmers. Voting local is something I can feel good about and proud of.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Making mistakes is okay.</strong> We are human, therefore imperfect. So, even though I try my best to vote for my local farmers, I acknowledge that it&#8217;s not always feasible. And that&#8217;s okay, too.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>You need to find contentment in solitude.</strong> Someday, I would like to have someone to call my &#8220;significant other&#8221;, but if my life continues on with phases of being single, in a relationship, uneasy breakups, awkward dates, and single again, I can now say to myself that being single is okay. I am not looking for my &#8220;other half&#8221;. I do not need someone to complete me; I feel whole on my own. (Having someone would be nice, but I can live a successful and happy life on my own as well is what I&#8217;m getting at.)</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Not all potential partners who break it off with you or vice versa are bad people.</strong> Everyone is at different stages in their lives and have had different experiences. Sometimes we have shitty relationships to teach us to appreciate good relationships. Sometimes good relationships come to an unanticipated end so that you can cherish the good moments in a relationship and learn how to cope when the waves are crashing. It&#8217;s all about perspective.</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>The world is not out to get you.</strong> There are a variety of factors in addition to your decisions that have resulted in what&#8217;s going on with you at this very minute, this very moment. Everything from a cop&#8217;s clever hiding spot (!!!!) to the numeric digits displayed in your online banking account. Life happens whether you&#8217;re ready for it or not. Sometimes life just happens to surprise us more so when we&#8217;re not prepared. That doesn&#8217;t mean the universe is conspiring against you. I promise.</li>
<li class="li1"><em>Speaking of online banking…</em> <strong>online banking is not a budget.</strong> You need to create a real, tangible budget. This is still a work in progress for me, but it&#8217;s getting better.</li>
<li class="li1">You don&#8217;t have to wear makeup or lose more weight to feel beautiful. <strong>Beauty really is something you feel on the inside.</strong> (I don&#8217;t care if this sounds like a Women&#8217;s Network or Lifetime flick. It&#8217;s hard to consider yourself beautiful with all of the taboo around people who have imperfections [i.e. acne, weight struggles, physical deformities, etc.] AND the expectations that clever media and marketing strategies have set up. You&#8217;re beautiful, inside and out. Keep that shit up, girl! (And boy. You&#8217;re beautiful, too!)</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Everything isn&#8217;t as bad as it seems.</strong> Stress can be a monster if you let it. (Refer to #2 and #10.)</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Exercise and being out in nature are better forms of therapy (and cheaper) than brownies and Netflix.</strong> (I&#8217;m noticing an unintentional pattern here with the brownie and Netflix references…) Your body actually needs a certain amount of fresh air everyday to help function. I&#8217;m sorry that I can&#8217;t recall the source off the top of my head, but if you go to Dr. Google, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find some citations confirming this. Anyway &#8211; go on that run outside. Walk the dog. Lay out in the sun. You deserve to feel good.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">All in all, I know very well that I don&#8217;t have everything figured out yet and I don&#8217;t think I ever truly will have everything all figured out. And age is just a number. It&#8217;s not like on the morning of my 25th birthday I realized all of these things. It took time, <em>lots and lots of time.</em> It took going through shitty situations. Coping with problems. Talking to friends and family. Constructive criticism. Self-affirmations. And so on.</p>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;ve got a long way to go and a lot more to learn, but I&#8217;ll continue to educate myself and more importantly continue to rock this life while I&#8217;m still here.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
						<p>This last summer and current fall semester&#8230; I have been either a:</p>
<p>A) Full-time student working two jobs, attempting to maintain sanity, and trying not to be sad about dealing with my very sick pet hedgehog (may he rest in peace now).</p>
<p>OR&#8230;</p>
<p>B) Full-time student working a full-time job, attempting to maintain sanity, and trying not to be sad about dealing with my very sick pet hedgehog (again, may he rest in peace now).</p>
<p>I am letter B at this time, but regardless the last 6 months of my life have been ever so busy and have actually made me question my sanity at times. I&#8217;d go out to lunch with my mom, she would make one inquiry or comment, something like, <strong>&#8220;are you just feeling like you&#8217;re not fitting in?&#8221; (true story&#8211;I don&#8217;t!)</strong> and then I&#8217;d have all of this built up stress and tension release out in waves of tears while the waitress next to me develops an uncomfortable look on her face that says <em>&#8220;really? All I did was ask if I could take your plate.&#8221;</em> Oh, how much I would have loved to blame hormones at that instance! The waitress did me no injustice whatsoever but that question from my parental unit was a trigger for me. The waitress and I patched things up (I may be the cliche poor college student, but I&#8217;m still a nice tipper) but I have yet to fully patch myself up. Basically, I resonate very much with the title of this post: feeling like you&#8217;re breaking down.</p>
<p>Some of you may have a lot more on your plate. Some of you have families that you are trying to manage while maintaining a healthy workout and dietary regimen. Some of you have internships. Some of you have a higher course load than I can even imagine. Some of you are running your own business. Some of you are getting married and/or having babies. And I see people like you succeeding all of the time&#8211; and although it&#8217;s horrible, I can&#8217;t help but compare myself to you and yell at myself, <em>&#8220;well, they can, so why can&#8217;t I?&#8221; </em>After this thought, I analyze my life as if it were some sort of science project by picking apart the pieces where I think I should be doing better, and then become infuriated and just take everything on my plate&#8211;school, work, personal stuff&#8211;and smash that plate to the ground and take a god damn nap. Because that&#8217;s all I feel like doing when I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m doing enough to be a &#8220;successful human&#8221;. In fact, I did that on my one day off this week&#8211;it was literally a self-loathing <strong>&#8220;WHY AREN&#8217;T YOU BETTER, GRACE?&#8221;</strong> kind of day and I did exactly that (took some god damn naps, that is). I woke up for lunch with my mom, went back to bed, then woke up for dinner, and went back to bed yet again. It&#8217;s embarrassing and depressing to admit that that&#8217;s how I spent my day off, but I myself felt spent&#8211;I felt like I had nothing good to offer to that day.</p>
<p><a href="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/comparison.jpg"><img id="i-1593" class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/comparison.jpg?w=488" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>After my day of self-loathing (of which has not been the first that I&#8217;m guilty of), I&#8217;m realizing more and more how essential it is for one&#8217;s <strong>mental health </strong>to stop breaking ourselves down, ripping ourselves apart from the seams. Whether we are doing this by overanalyzing our work, educational endeavours, family ties, relationships, personal lives, or a medley of all, we need to acknowledge where we are excelling and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">remember that no matter what,</span><em> we are still beautiful despite what we may deem as our &#8220;shortcomings&#8221;.</em> I don&#8217;t mean beautiful in materialistic terms. I mean the kind of beautiful that allows us to love and appreciate others for who they are: after all, we do it all the time, don&#8217;t we?! Think about it. How often are we praising others for being such great people? Exhibit A: Someone from my work brings me fresh herbs from her garden (or well, did, rather&#8211;before it got too cold here in the butt crack of Wisconsin!) and I find myself thinking ever so highly of her and thank her for her kindness. Why aren&#8217;t we acting this way to ourselves when we are being kind or accomplishing goals? It seems like we neglect the goodness that we offer and only shed light on everything we do not do. We are not appreciating ourselves! To me, as long as we are accomplishing our goals that we regularly set for ourselves, both big and SMALL (but always aiming high!) and are being kind to others, then we are beautiful and need to stop giving ourselves so much shit for supposedly &#8220;not doing enough&#8221;. Because in fact, we are then doing quite the opposite of &#8220;not enough&#8221;: we are regularly doing something great, and that&#8217;s fucking fabulous!</p>
<p>To close, I really appreciate the quote posted above because honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter if I am &#8220;supposedly&#8221; doing less than someone else and everyone else seems to be doing more. We have to remember that we all have our own struggles which makes everyone&#8217;s journey in life a little different from the rest. Some will need more or less time to &#8220;succeed&#8221;, and what &#8220;success&#8221; is will vary per individual. And though this may not be the case for everyone, I do think a majority of people want to advertise their lives as being if not fully joyous at least somewhat enjoyable, and in an effort to do that we do our best to masquerade our struggles&#8211;which many of us have become quite skilled at.</p>
<p>Comparing our lives to others and beating ourselves up for &#8220;not being good enough&#8221; is only going to make this life we have been given much harder than it needs to be. It&#8217;s time to stop telling ourselves &#8220;well if they can do it, why can&#8217;t I?&#8221; and replace it with &#8220;I can and will do whatever I damn well please. Because bitch, I&#8217;m fabulous.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Okay, maybe not exactly that&#8230;.</strong> but you catch my drift <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>.</p>

				</h2>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
						<p><strong>LADIES AND GENTS, in a perfect world, I would have the following;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most intelligent, beautiful, and dedicated pool boy in the universe (just in case there really ends up being life on some other planet). Oh, and a pool to go with him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A credit card with no limit, no interest, and no payments.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The</span> classic black Chanel purse.</li>
<li>Ted Allen from Chopped or Perez Hilton as my BFF.</li>
<li>A Vitamix.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I have none of those and some of those might be just slightly unrealistic. Only a pinch, though. I cannot make substitutes for all of these things BUT one of these items I have kind of been able to bargain for, and that is the holy grail of all blenders, the Zeus of all Greeks, the most stubbly hair of all hair stubbles&#8230;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>THE</strong><strong> VITAMIX!</strong></span></p>
<p>For those of you who may be unfamiliar with this item I am raving about, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">basically if there is a God and if he/she/it had a blender, this would be it</span>. I heard a girl once threw in an orange peel and it still came out into a pulverized liquid. How fucking boss is that?!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though I can get a discount from my gym, I still don&#8217;t have $400/$500 dollars handy to get my hands on one of these. Also, being a broke ass bitch, I really have to prioritize my spending. I&#8217;m horrible at that, but I&#8217;m working on it. Most days anyway.</p>
<p><em>SO&#8230;onto the beef. Or the liquidized vegetables. I don&#8217;t know.</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whatever</span>. <strong>ANYWAYS,</strong> I do happen to have a few kitchen appliances, major ones include a food processor, juicer, and a shitty &#8220;frappe maker&#8221; which is really just a glorified coffee machine and a blender built into one. Don&#8217;t ask why I bought that. Not all of my purchases are sensical.</p>
<p>Since my blender blows, making green smoothies (and just any flavored smoothie in general) really was not my thing. The fruits and veggies wouldn&#8217;t properly blend all the way (random bits and pieces of pulp floating around), the ice would never and will likely never get fully broken down, and well&#8230;yeah, it just sucks. But it&#8217;s decent enough to break down a majority of ice cubes but not strong enough to break down my veggies. My food processor is not meant to break down ice but it is intended to (and does a damn good job of it) slaughter vegetables Texas Chainsaw Massacre style. Appetizing, right? But for real&#8230;80&#8217;s song &#8220;this is how we do it!&#8221; Or is that 90&#8217;s? Either way, here&#8217;s the easy peasy lemon squeezy process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in your food processor. It is SO annoying when you don&#8217;t think it works but then see that it was simply unplugged all along&#8230;<em><em>a very embarrassing &#8220;oh&#8221; face.</em></em></li>
<li>Begin with your vegetables. I have only experimented using leafy greens/vegetables that would break up easily, but feel free to experiment if you wish. For this one I made, I probably used about 1 stalk of rainbow chard, 2 handfulls of kale, cup of spinach, and a few sprigs of parsley <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>. Use whatever you would like (maybe something that is on the verge of going bad&#8211;good way to use it up!) and pulverize the shit out of it for a few minutes.</li>
<li>After this, add in whatever fruits you may desire. I actually ended up using half of an avocado and one dried fig. Also squeezed some lemon juice from half of a lemon. Pulsate this bitch for another few minutes until you achieve a pudding-y texture. You might want to avoid using harder fruits such as an apple. I refuse to take off the skin because that&#8217;s where a majority of its nutrients lie, but blending with the skin is still awkward. Mangoes, kiwis, lemons, and some dried fruits work well in my experience.</li>
<li>After this, add in whatever oils, syrups, spices, herbs, or whatever that you may want to. In order to sweeten it up, I used 1 and 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of raw local honey. I also kept a can of coconut milk in my fridge so that I could scoop off 1/8 to 1/4 cup roughly of the fatty part that rises to the top when chilled. I also added in 1 cup of unsweetened almond/coconut milk (delightful blend by Blue Diamond brand &#8211; yum!). I also incorporated 1 tablespoon of chia seeds for the sake of protein, but then I remembered avocados already have lots of protein&#8230;oh well.</li>
<li>Let this pulsate for a few minutes until you get to a slightly thick texture, something similar to the picture below (note that it might not be all that thick if you don&#8217;t use an avocado):</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Using a spatula, slide in half of your processed mixture. Add in 4-6 ice cubes (feel free to add in more or less depending on your desired consistency). AND YES, I know it looks like slime but it was delicious slime. Deal with it.</li>
<li>Blend until you get the consistency then you want and sprinkle some coconut flakes on top (optional). Overall was a delicious mid-day pick me up!</li>

						<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pretty Dope Kale Chips</span>&#8221;<br />
</strong><em>(for a lack of better words&#8230;this title will have to suffice. I&#8217;ll take any suggestions!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://nutrisassy.com/2013/05/08/a-simple-kale-chip-recipe-thats-pretty-dope-actually/kalechips/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1240"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1240" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kalechips.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="kalechips" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">INGREDIENTS</span>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;"><span style="line-height:14px;">2 Stalks of kale (BIG ONES!)</span></span></li>
<li>1 Tablespoon of olive oil (may substitute melted coconut oil, but may be more or less than 1 TBSP.)</li>
<li>1/2 &#8211; 1 Tsp. of apple cider vinegar (I actually just used the lid of the apple cider vinegar bottle as a measurer and just splashed over the kale however much the lid could hold&#8211;no real estimate really, but I would be sure to not go more than 1 tsp.!)</li>
<li>1-3 squeezes of lemon.</li>
<li>3-5 dashes (or to taste, I think I used 5 dashes) of pink salt (may use sea salt/regular salt).</li>
<li>Himalayan salt, also known as rock salt, to your liking (it&#8217;s optional &#8212; I just like to incorporate it whenever I can since this one is actually really good for you!)</li>
<li>Black pepper to taste</li>
<li>Ground ginger to taste (1-3 dashes)</li>
<li>Sirracha (optional &#8211; may spritz all over at end!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><br />
INSTRUCTIONS</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;"><span style="line-height:14px;"><span style="line-height:14px;">Pre-heat often to 375.</span></span></span></li>
<li>Get a bowl and drop in the 1 tbsp. of olive oil.</li>
<li>Take one stalk of kale and rip apart leaves from stem. The shapes do NOT have to be uniform; but they shouldn&#8217;t range from itsy bitsy to larger than life. For an idea of how big (roughly) each of my leaves were, make a circle with your thumb and that pointer finger of yours &#8212; my kale leaves in size were a little smaller than that or slightly larger.<a href="http://nutrisassy.com/2013/05/08/a-simple-kale-chip-recipe-thats-pretty-dope-actually/sizekalechips/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1238"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1238 aligncenter" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sizekalechips.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="sizekalechips" width="225" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>You will have some very dinky ones in size near the beginning and ends of the stem due to this veggie&#8217;s nature. Feel free to leave them out or try to make kale chips out of them if you&#8217;d like, but expect to either take the small ones out of the oven earlier or to eat burnt pieces of kale. The choice is yours.</p>
<p></em></li>
<li>Repeat this process with the remaining stalk of kale.</li>
<li>Pour the apple cider vinegar and lemon juice over the kale. You&#8217;ll be mixing it with your HANDS (yes, hands &#8212; it&#8217;s the best way to get everything covered!), so don&#8217;t worry about trying to pour it evenly over the kale.</li>
<li>Add in the rest of your spices &#8212; pink salt, himalayan salt, black pepper, and ground ginger.</li>
<li>Make sure your hands are clean (but without remnants of soap! Yuck.) and massage the kale. That sounds awkward, I know, but seriously just massage the oil and spices into the kale already. Do so until the kale leaves have been covered with everything! Should only take a couple minutes at most <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>.</li>
<li>Lay each kale leaf flat on a pan (I used a pan that was <a title="Pan w/ holes" href="http://www.fantes.com/images/2794pizza.jpg">like this</a> but only square) being sure to not lay them on top of each other. You could also use a cookie sheet, but I think using something like a pizza pan or even a wire cooling rack would work much, much better. Makes them more crispy and less limp (unlike one of my last boyfriends. Woops!).</li>
<li>Put in the oven for 7 minutes. Keep an eye on them and be sure to check them at 4 or 5 to see how they are doing. I like mine more on the crispy side so 7 was perfect for me!</li>
<li><strong>Makes one very selfish (but not all that naughty) serving <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Oh, and if you dare&#8230;</em></strong>I added sirracha to mine at the end, glazed it on top of the kale chips. It was a very &#8220;hot&#8221; experience&#8230;totally worth it, though!</p>

				</h2>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
						<p>In an effort to reduce the &#8220;goo&#8221; in my life, AKA use of skincare products (this also applies for hair products and makeup&#8230; but I&#8217;m kind of sort of having a hard time letting all of that go), I try to make some stuff on my own. I&#8217;ve been able to make a basic body scrub which is cost effective and gets the job done just fine.</p>
<p>With this body scrub, there really aren&#8217;t specific &#8220;measurements&#8221;: which makes it fun, because that way, it&#8217;s all up to you! You get to play. And ways to test out whether or not you like your product, you can be your own test subject and try using the scrub with your hands under the sink using warm water. Here&#8217;s at least a sample framework of how to go about making your own body scrub, as well as some of the experiences I had during the process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">TROUBLESHOOTING/DIRECTIONS&#8230;KIND OF.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em style="line-height:1.5;">Brown sugar</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"> clumps up and does not work well. White sugar is much more fine and does not contain molasses (which is what brown sugar is, basically: sugar + molasses) which makes the consistency a little easier to work with. Makes it not as thick/clumpy basically. I personally like to use organic just because I feel like it’s nice to not have preservatives on my skin, but it just so happens that my mom doesn’t really bake anymore so she gave me her big bag of sugar so I can use it for that. Score. It’s all about personal preference or what my wallet does and does not allow me to do.
<p></span></span></li>
<li><em style="line-height:1.5;">Using/adding water,</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"> (depending on how much and the ratio of sugar to water) to the concoction will help better combine the sugar concoction, but it will separate and needs to be shaken or stirred up (with a utensil or your hands midst shower) before each use. And quite frankly, adding water makes the scrub look kind of gross (aesthetics are not highly important here though). I prefer the feel of honey versus water, but sometimes it&#8217;s more convenient to just add water. You can use both honey and water if you want to. Works either way.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://nutrisassy.com/2013/04/14/diygs-why-the-hell-didnt-i-think-of-that-easy-as-balls-body-scrub/img_4424-2/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1155"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1155" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_44241.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_4424" width="225" height="300" /></a><br />
<em>PMA (Prior to Mixing Action)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Adding</span><em style="line-height:1.5;"> essential oils</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"> that are safe on skin is a great way to add scent in there! Since I don&#8217;t have oils around as often as I&#8217;d like to, I use orange or lemon zest and drops of orange or lemon juice (or sometimes both if I feel so inclined).
<p></span></span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:1.5;">I have tried </span><em style="line-height:1.5;">honey</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"> and it works well, but quite honestly—regular water and white sugar can do just the trick, or something else I&#8217;ve done in the past is </span><strong style="line-height:1.5;"><strong style="line-height:1.5;"><strong><strong><strong><strong>brew some tea – lavender chamomile tea – and use that in place of water.</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> You&#8217;re still using water, essentially, but now it&#8217;s got more of a scent to it and you get some of the good stuff in tea onto your skin, which is good, right?</li>
<li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Make sure that you use more sugar than water if you go the water route. Stir it up, maybe use honey in addition to it if you like and voila, it works practically the exact same as your St. Ives’ apricot exfoliator (this is probably way less harsh on your face, too!)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://nutrisassy.com/2013/04/14/diygs-why-the-hell-didnt-i-think-of-that-easy-as-balls-body-scrub/img_4430-2/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-1156"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1156 aligncenter" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_44301.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_4430" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And it’s way cheaper. Sure, buying one bag of sugar + a container of honey + tea or essential oils might add up to be more than $4.95 + tax, but you can make at LEAST three times as many bottles – so what would you rather pay, 4 times as much or not? <em>Also, wouldn’t it be nice to know for once what the fuck you’re actually putting on your skin?</em> (I don’t know about you but despite looking up ingredients, I still can’t recognize more than half of the shit listed on the ingredients list of fancy shmancy beauty/skincare products. One only has so much time to spend researching and sifting through articles!)</p>

						<p>We&#8217;ve all been in relationships that are emotionally abusive&#8230;eye-creams has been one of them; &#8220;<em>you and I are working well together</em>&#8221; &#8220;<em>wait, NO, NO WE ARE NOT WORKING OUT</em>&#8220;, <em>&#8220;I thought you cared about me!</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>you are just a waste of my money and my time!</em>&#8221; &#8230;etc. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>. <strong>Here are some of my past eye-cream relationships:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing</li>
<li>Tanning lotion&#8230;as in going to tanning beds without eye goggles on and putting tanning lotion on my lids and under my eye lids to avoid getting racoon eyes (this was very, very, VERY BAD. One of the tanning girls suggested this to me but not to tell anyone that she told me that&#8230;probably because, oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8211;now I have potential cancer cells there because of all the damage? This is true actually. My dermatologist looked through some big lens doo-dad after I told him of this crime against myself.)</li>
<li>Estée<em> </em>Lauder Idealist eye cream</li>
<li>Coconut oil (cold-pressed &amp; organic)</li>
<li>Grapeseed oil (organic)</li>
<li>Manuka honey eye cream</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these probably make you think, &#8220;okay, well, that&#8217;s weird but I kind of get it&#8221;&#8230;but what might be on your mind moreso is<em><strong> &#8220;what the hell is manuka honey?&#8221;</strong></em> Well the discovery didn’t happen on my own; my grandma was talking to me around the holidays of how she had a friend from New Zealand who brought as a gift to her this awesome type of hand cream. Unfortunately she used it all up and was pretty torn that she didn&#8217;t have any left. Gramcakes is in her older age and her computer is from the stone age so I decided to do some research on Amazon and get her that for Xmas. The <a title="Manuka Honey Lotion" href="http://www.amazon.com/Manuka-Honey-Wild-Ferns-Butter/dp/B003TSJ5T2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363642592&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=manuka+honey+cream" target="_blank">lotion</a> is so light and hydrating, I really recommend it! If I didn&#8217;t have like&#8230;5+ bottles of lotion laying around that I&#8217;m already trying to use up, then I probably would have bought some for myself as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, as we&#8217;re all aware, whenever you check out a product on Amazon or pretty much any other site, often times they show you similar products that they have. I was almost out of my Estee Lauder eye cream and was on the prowl for a new eye cream that was not so infested with chemical shit, so I clicked on over to this <a title="Manuka Honey Eye Cream" href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Ferns-Manuka-Honey-Cream/dp/B00161I2NO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363645654&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=manuka+honey+eye+cream" target="_blank">manuka honey eye cream </a>by a company called &#8220;Wild Ferns&#8221; and decided to give it a try. After about 3 and 1/2 months of use, here are my verdicts:</p>
<p><a href="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eyecream.jpg"><img id="i-412" class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" src="http://nutrisassy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eyecream.jpg?w=630" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Though it does not fully match up to the awesomeness that was my chemical shit storm Estee Lauder Idealist eye cream in my personal opinion, it is $45 cheaper and just as hydrating if not even more so. Did not have any skin-cooling applicator like the Idealist did though. Application was finger-based, which is fine, but I like having an applicator (just a personal preference).</li>
<li>I used it twice a day rather than once a day as recommended on the box; the fact that I could&#8217;ve potentially gotten six months of use rather than just three and a half by following directions is pretty cool to know. I don&#8217;t think using it twice a day was wasteful, though&#8211;your eyes and the skin surrounding your eyes are pretty fucking important, and after annihilating them as much as I did, I like to do my best to take better care of them now.</li>
<li>Appears to have more natural ingredients than the Idealist eye cream did. (If you&#8217;re wondering what manuka honey is exactly, check out a brief tidbit of its historical background <a title="Manuka Honey Historical Background" href="http://www.whatishoney.net/manuka-honey-history/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The texture of the manuka honey was smooth and creamy while still being very light and airy&#8211;made my skin feel smooth like satin once my skin totally soaked up all of its goodies. The cream would dry up in about 10-15 minutes post application.</li>
<li>Over the course of time, the cream did seem like it helped decrease the noticeability of my dark under-eye circles and made them look less &#8220;tired&#8221;, if you will.</li>
<li>$13 + shipping and handling versus $60+&#8230;you do the math and let me know which one my debit card, Debra, prefers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though a great product overall, I do not think that I&#8217;ll be pulling a Daft Punk by celebrating it one more time but solely for finance&#8217;s sake. I realize that $13 every few months isn&#8217;t all that bad, but since my manuka honey eye cream has been gone I&#8217;ve resorted back to olive oil in the evenings and coconut oil in the mornings, both of which are exceptionally hydrating <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>. Minus the fact that the oil can get stuck between my lashes and make things look a little blurry on seldom occasion they both work out just fine. I also decided to purchase actual manuka honey in an attempt to make my own eye cream sometime&#8230; but I ended up kind of sort of totally eating it all with my almond butter (delicious combination, guilty as charged). If you are interested in purchasing manuka honey, try going to a co-op or health/wellness store in town first to see if it is something that they already have available or if it is a product that they could order for you. Odds are it&#8217;d be cheaper from them than from Amazon. Otherwise if you cannot find manuka honey in your area, <a title="Manuka Honey" href="http://www.amazon.com/Active-Manuka-Health-New-Zealand/dp/B001O0BL9E/ref=pd_sbs_gro_1" target="_blank">here is the one I bought</a> that is listed on Amazon for a few bucks more. Check out the product description and some of the customer reviews to get some additional input.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone has their facial flaws and their weighty woes,</strong></em> but regardless, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I truly believe</span> that a healthy diet and organic, natural skin care regimen can help reduce the visibility of my dark under eye circles and constant tired-look without having to buy some fancy shmancy cream that tells me otherwise <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>. Manuka honey is known to have very beneficial medicinal properties which makes it great for consumption and topical purposes. I found this page that lists some of that information, so <a title="Manuka Honey Benefits" href="http://www.manukasea.com.au/blog/history-of-manuka-honey-it-s-origin-and-reason-for-popularityhistory-of-manuka-honey-its-origin-and-reason-for-popularity" target="_blank">click here</a> to check it out if you&#8217;re interested!</p>
<p>Hopefully you found this information useful. And if not, well, then at least you learned something new <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>. And if you didn&#8217;t learn something new&#8230;well then you can pat yourself on the back for knowing all kinds of awesome shit!</p>

				</h2>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
						<p><strong>Ladies and gents,</strong> this is the post I have concocted for you today when trying to think of reasons why the fuck I continue to exercise and shit. Weight loss and overall health are great motivators, but something more personal, more close to home, is needed to help me keep along the way. As a result, I came up with this: “change is like exercise. It’s hard, but it’s good for you and you typically feel better afterwards.” Now THAT is what motivates me to stay on track. Even though I’m young and impressionable along with gullible (after all, it’s written on my ceiling), I can have a hard time inviting change into my life. I’m very much a schedule-oriented type of girl. Sure, I like a few sporadic things to happen in my life every now and then, but not like I used to (anyone that knew me at the age of 21 will understand this completely. For the rest, I’m sure the age gives you a good general idea). The reason I like, no, <strong>NEED</strong> to have a schedule is because it helps make me feel more <em>balanced</em>. I need to make sure I get 8-10 (yes, 8-10) hours of sleep every night otherwise I will feel exhausted for the rest of the day. I have really low blood pressure, which is good I guess, always have had it, but I get worn out very easily. If I get a good night’s sleep/rest, then I don’t have to worry about that or let it dampen my mood or let that exhaustion develop into crankiness. If I’m not cranky, then I’m not necessarily happy, but I am at least content. Having no stressors on my mind makes it easier for me to go about my day and get tasks done. When one of those pillars of my life is out of whack, then my entire world like some sort of domino effect comes to be unbalanced as well.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS&#8230;how does this relate to my exercise history? Well, I’ve tried a bunch of different types of workouts, programs, agendas, etc. I would go to the gym and just do cardio 5-6 days a week. Then I tried having a personal trainer. And after that it would be solely aerobic classes 4 days a week then cardio once or twice. Exercise videos at home from hardcore strength training (P90X, anyone? Yeah, I did that shit—even did it and finished when I was at my heaviest. BAM.) to a combination of light cardio and very “frou frou” aerobics (i.e. pilates/yoga). It was not the workouts that made my potentially great success entirely faulty; it was my  lack of bringing intensity and little commitment that did the injustice  Exercise is a long-term relationship that will eventually put out if you work it hard enough. But you can’t be too pushy, otherwise you’ll be putting your hardwork into reverse, backing that ass up a few pounds along the way.</p>
<p>It’s easy to tell yourself, “oh, I’ll just do this workout program, watch my calories, and look like Jessica Alba right after!&#8221; (Okay, not exactly like that, but a Wisconsin-made version of her who happens to still enjoy beer and cheese.) Talk is talk, but can you back up your talk with some solid, consistent actions? Apparently, I did not care to walk that walk, but I&#8217;m working on it now (better late than never). I could have walked that walk sooner, but chose not to. I would do the workouts at home and although I would have Tony Horton or Debbie Siebers telling me to “PUMP IT!”, “SQUEEZE THOSE BUNS!”, or “BRING IT, BRING IT, BRING IT!!!!”, I still found it impeccably easy to hit the pause button and take a piss or water break that could’ve easily been held off until the end of the workout. Sure, I’d push myself, but I had way more potential that could have been put to good use, and all I did was neglect it. <i>Neglect. Neglect. Neglect.</i></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">As of recently</span>, I found a gym with a program in which a variety of classes are provided six days per week. You are required to attend at least four sessions each week in order to get results. In addition, they provide you information on nutrition, supplements, and advice on how to perfect form. I do my best to go to five classes per week then do yoga/core training at home during the weekend one day, and then take a day off for rest. So far, of everything that I’ve tried, this has worked the best for me. Why is that? The P90X program offered perfect nutrition advice in the diet/food guide provided. The Team Beach Body website is a perfect resource for any questions/concerns people may have about particular workouts, movements, diet, foods, form, etc. As for my aerobic class spree, I went to pilates/yoga regularly and did my best to eat mostly fruits, vegetables, and proteins, so why didn’t that work? Why is this current program supposedly the holy grail of them all?</p>
<p><b>My current regimen works because it help me recognize my weaknesses and provided me with the resources and support to challenge those weaknesses.</b></p>
<p><b> </b>It’s so eye-opening to me how much more I can put into a workout when I have someone not only motivating me to push myself, but also helping keep myself in check to make sure that I don’t wimp out by taking unnecessary breaks or not fully pushing myself. I was never so hot at giving my all, and with this regimen, I am now able to do so. I could have done so before with other programs, but having that sense of community is what really helps me put out the best, strongest me that I can be when kicking those punching bags or doing push-ups on that rugged, rubbery floor.</p>
<p>As for the diet portion of it, at the end of day, if I really wanted to lose weight at that time, I would not have allowed my weaknesses—going out to dinner 3-4 days per week (and eating shitty-for-you foods), getting tipsy with friends, late night “munchies”—gotten the best of me. <strong>You can tell yourself “<em>oh, it’s only one time, I&#8217;ll be fine</em>”, but that “one time</strong>” usually happened much more than once or twice a week, and over time, it adds up. I guarantee you that if I was more adamant with my P90X diet and pushed myself harder during the workouts that I could have lost way more than 14 pounds. But I wasn’t adamant and I didn’t push myself. I kept saying, “oh whatever, it’ll be fine”. Fact is, I wasn’t fine—I was not committed enough to myself and my goals. Exercise, eating healthy, nutrition, sleep, all of these components make up a long-term relationship that needs as much attention and effort as a new puppy does to help keep improving and progressing towards your desired outcome (but there is a lot less “shit” involved).</p>
<p>When it comes to discovering what your motivators are, it’s no “one-size fits all” type of matter. Some of my “motivators” used to be “not get fat like those chicks on Jerry Springer and Maury”, or “be good looking enough to get a boyfriend”. Not only were those “motivators” artificial and completely self-absorbed, but also were worded ever so negatively. Think about what it is that you want and reasons why. Obviously, it would be nice to look good in a bikini—but what other sincere purposes could losing weight and getting healthier serve? Perhaps more energy to go and play with your nieces and nephews, take your dogs out for a walk (they need exercise too! plus, odds are, they miss you), feel more comfortable in your own skin&#8230;I could keep going, but there are an infinite number of reasons, or motivators, that could help you continue to be good on your food intake and exercise even on the days that seem the hardest. Find what you are most passionate about and incorporate that with how getting healthy would help better what you&#8217;re passionate about. Linking such motivators to your personal life like that makes commitment a much easier task, for me at least, and I think it can work for you too. Oh, and be sure to write your motivators down and put them up somewhere you can see them everyday&#8211;the mirror or a dry-erase board on the fridge can work out well.</p>
<p>Moral of the story (this is apparently one of my favorite phrases if you haven’t noticed—<em>and yes, I do have morals, thank you very much</em>), though it’s hard to confess to yourself that you go out and drink way too many cocktails than you should (those can add up—seriously, search some of your favorite mixed drinks and look up the calories for it. You’ll be surprised). It’s hard to admit that you eat practically nothing all day then binge-eat at night. <b>It’s even harder to tell yourself that you think you can do these things and still make it work by overdoing exercise, which is exactly what I did. </b> All in all, I think that everyone’s life needs balance—I didn’t balance my diet, so I overdid my workouts (as in how many per day/week, not necessarily how much I pushed myself). But not just balance in the physical area of our lives, also the psychological ones as well—mental health, length and quality of sleep, etc.</p>
<p>Learning to work WITH exercise programs/regimens that refrain me from giving in to my weaknesses, AKA slacking, works best for me. Not overthinking what I’m eating but just trying to eat what mother nature provides has helped me freak out less about what I put into my body. Determining my success by how I feel and not what the scale tells me (which is just a number that does not tell us our muscle and bone mass—as you workout, muscle gets larger and is much more dense than fat) and just by how my clothes feel. This gives me a more balanced mindset (less crazy outbursts, basically).  By practicing this regularly if not religiously, I cannot tell you how fabulous I am learning to feel about myself physically and mentally. Sure, I’m still self-conscious about my body, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but my self-esteem and personal body image are much more positive</span>. I don’t yell at myself or give me a hard time anymore. That’s something we all should be striving for, not just a “hot bod”. Oh, and remember to eat for fuel—not for fun. (But do remember that it is okay to have a treat on occasion.) It’s a hard habit to break, but you can do it. If I can reduce my ketchup intake (<em>rumor has it one does not need ½ cup of ketchup for a cheeseburger and ¼ cup for French fries—something I would do regularly</em>), then you can do fucking anything! We’re all pretty strong individuals and we tend to forget that. It’s time to bring that strong, confident, hot ass bitch in you out—she (or he) has a lot of joy to bring into your world. Make it happen.</p>

				</h2>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Originally, for this title, I was going to put &#8220;What the Hell is a Paraben and Why <i>Should</i> I care?&#8221; Seriously, think about&#8211;when you see some product, whether it is a makeup, deodorant, face wash, body scrub, astringent, or whatever&#8211;if it says paraben-free, you are more inclined to purchase the product, no? Yes, you are. You suddenly develop a reason to give a shit. Odds are that you do, anyway&#8211;and if not, then please share with me how you are able to regularly remind yourself (and enforce such behavior) that this is all just clever advertising and wording to suck you into making a purchase&#8230;because unfortunately, I have always been gullible, and probably will be for the rest of my days&#8211;despite my efforts :p. What can I say, people with pretty faces, flowery language, and catchy background music are hard not to trust. Just kidding. Seriously, I am really joking there.</p>
<p>Anyway, when shopping for anything beauty and/or cosmetics-related, your first thought probably isn&#8217;t &#8220;omigosh, need to make sure it&#8217;s paraben-free!&#8221;, or is it? Honestly, until products started putting such disclaimers on their packaging, I had no idea what a paraben even was. Actually, I still don&#8217;t know what it is&#8211;which is why I figured I would do a little research, since I have a feeling that I&#8217;m not the only one. Rumor has it that it&#8217;s good to purchase products that are fragrance-free because it can irritate skin, among many other ingredients that can be harmful to one&#8217;s skin and innards, but why the F do I suddenly care about whether or not my face wash is paraben-free?</p>
<p>According to Google Define (as in, go to google and type in the search bar: &#8220;define ____&#8221; and it will give you one or multiple definitions of the word from various sources), a <b>paraben</b> is defined as <strong>&#8220;any of a group of compounds used as preservatives in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and in the food industry.&#8221;</strong> So, basically, in Grace language, paraben is just a fancy word for preservatives that are used in products that typically aren&#8217;t edible, like body wash, unless you&#8217;re into that sort of thing&#8230;then you have bigger problems and I would highly suggest that you go see a therapist.</p>
<p>Of course, all of us are very capable of going into google and typing in &#8220;WHY ARE PARABENS BAD? WTF?&#8221;, so in an attempt to find a more reliable source/study to refer to, I decided to search for the reasons for this by using databases that my school provides specifically for students, and all of the articles have been published (and most have been peer-reviewed) by valid, reliable sources.</p>
<p>Well, a variety of articles came up&#8211;and just for fun, here are the titles of some of the articles that popped up:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The Perils of Parabens</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>US Industry Panel Says Parabens Are Safe</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Brussels Plots Parabens Restrictions In Cosmetics</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera&#8230;(apparently, that&#8217;s how you spell &#8220;etc.&#8221;, so I thought I&#8217;d just be all kinds of classy and shit by sharing that with you. Okay, by adding the word &#8220;shit&#8221; to that last sentence, I realize that all class was thrown out the window, but whatever. You&#8217;ll be okay.)</p>
<p>Sadly, of the three articles I listed, I was only able to access the first article for free, but it had a good chunk of fairly interesting information&#8211;of which I would like to share with you, because really&#8211;if we are putting shit like this on our skin, knowingly, willingly, or not, we should at least know what it is. As human beings, I think that we should be entitled to such information and that such insight should be made easily accessible, not something available only to those with thick wallets and fancy credit cards.</p>
<p>In the article titled &#8220;The Perils of Parabens&#8221;, here is some key information regarding the dangers of parabens, which again are a type of preservative to help make products last:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Chemicals in Our Beauty Products Linked to Breast Cancer&#8221; by Lindsey Blomberg, from The Environmental Magazine; the November/December 2012 issue.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Parabens are widely used as germ-fighting preservatives in a number of cosmetics and personal care products including deodorant, shampoo, makeup, lotion and toothpaste.<strong>Methylparaben and propylparaben are the most common, each appearing in well over 10,000 of the 25,000 products</strong> in the Environmental Working Group&#8217;s Skin Deep cosmetic-analyzing database. According to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, parabens are known to disrupt hormone function &#8212; an effect that is linked to an <strong>increased risk of breast cancer</strong> and reproductive toxicity. <em>Parabens mimic the female sex hormone estrogen (which plays a central role in puberty and reproduction) by binding to estrogen receptors on cells.</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, a comprehensive study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Applied Technology showed evidence of a correlation between parabens and incidences of breast cancer. Researchers from the University of Reading in the UK found that virtually all of the breast cancer tissue samples collected from women participating in the study contained at least one paraben, and more than half of the samples contained no less than five parabens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, maybe those girls who are all anti-well, anti-perspirants aren&#8217;t so crazy for having a little stink up in their pits after all. Even when I worked at a cosmetics counter, one of the counter managers, we&#8217;ll call her Georgia, told me how she was sure to use only deodorants rather than anti-perspirants because she had heard about how they caused breast cancer; in all honesty, I was more of a punk-ass back then than I am now (the punk-ass-ness has lessened now, I promise) and thought she was just a weirdo with odd superstitions. In reality, she was just concerned about her well-being&#8211;something I have just begun to care about within the past few years. Since I&#8217;m young still, I like to think that although I can&#8217;t reverse damage I&#8217;ve already done to my body&#8211;such as my liver (sorry, buddy&#8211;thanks for hanging in there still!)&#8211;I can at least help prevent any future damage. After all, this is the only vessel I&#8217;ve got to work with&#8211;and I&#8217;d like to live as long as possible to piss people off (and to inspire&#8230;obviously&#8230;hence the blog&#8230;but some people just suck and deserve a verbal can of whoop-ass) until the end of my days <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span>.</p>
<p>Anywho, I tried to open up the articles of the other two titles I listed, but unfortunately I was unable to access them and could not discover a way to do so&#8211;well, I could not find a way to get the articles for free, but even so, just looking at the titles alone, I find it kind of funny the good ol&#8217; U.S. of A. says that parabens are supposedly okay, but then Brussels decided to work on banning the ingredients because they are apparently toxic to one&#8217;s health? Guess the US will do all it can for the almighty dollar, whereas other countries don&#8217;t mind making a few bucks less as long as they can help improve the quality of life for their people. That is a slight exaggeration on this subject, and I should do a little more research on it so I sound less like an asshole (but mostly because I am intrigued), but in articles I&#8217;ve read comparing the United States to other countries in regards to matters of education, welfare, government, and so on&#8230;it seems to me that we just want &#8220;mo&#8217; money&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8211;other countries like money as well, I&#8217;m sure, but even when it comes to illnesses, such as diabetes, it seems like the FDA APPEARS TO BE more concerned about giving drug companies approval for pills that supposedly have magical abilities to &#8220;cure&#8221; (or minimize/reduce the effects of) diabetes rather than to try to implement programs or provide free seminars open to the public regarding health&#8211;from nutrition, lifestyle (i.e. smoking), to fitness and beyond. Then again, the drug industry is worth far too many billions of dollars for the FDA to deny, whereas providing such education may cost nearly a fraction of that, but such knowledge doesn&#8217;t generate the profits that life-threatening illnesses do. <em>*Sighs at corporations and corrupt government institutions*.</em></p>
<p><strong>So parabens?</strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Yes, you should care whether or not they&#8217;re in your products</span>&#8211;but not just parabens, you should really look into all of your products and see if they have harmful ingredients&#8211;from shower soaps, face washes, makeup, lotion, and so on&#8211;to see if they are safe for you and your family to use in the long run. (Side-note, gluten is typically not used in makeup, so be sure to watch out for disclaimers like that. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;dairy-free almond milk&#8221;. Well, no shit it&#8217;s dairy-free&#8211;it&#8217;s almond milk&#8230;) I&#8217;m not trying to freak you out and make you feel obligated to throw everything you own away that isn&#8217;t &#8220;organic&#8221; or &#8220;au naturale&#8221;, because obviously:</p>
<p><strong>1) That&#8217;s unfair.</strong> I am still working on revamping my makeup and skincare collections myself.</p>
<p><strong>2) Unrealistic. </strong>Even if my toothpaste was not eco-friendly, by god I will use my toothpaste because I just ate garlic and I will not make my classmates suffer the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>3) We don&#8217;t all have deep pockets</strong>. In addition, we don&#8217;t all necessarily have the time to research what goodies we should use and what naughties we should be certain to ignore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that this method will work for you, but what I&#8217;ve been doing is, when I have the time to, researching types of products I will need to buy relatively soon and look into recommendations that online references, books, or professionals (if given the opportunity&#8211;i.e. dermatologists) provide. For example, I love my Barbasol shaving cream (which now goes by the name of &#8220;Pure Silk&#8221;, just FYI), but I honestly am not sure if it&#8217;s the best for my skin&#8211;for all I know, it might have some shit intended to dry my skin out, making my skin feel dry in the shower, or something, which in turn makes me feel like putting on even more dollops of shaving cream than necessary. That means I&#8217;d run out of shaving cream sooner, meaning I&#8217;d have to buy more in a timely manner&#8211;and if I liked that specific brand, I would then purchase from that brand once again. Lifelong customers are how businesses like that make their money. Anywho, as I was saying, once I&#8217;m starting to get low on a product, I&#8217;ll look online, see the reviews of Barbasol&#8217;s shaving cream ingredients (for example) and keep an open eye for any article titles or phrases that stick out&#8211;like, &#8220;Shaving cream X has _____ ingredients in it, which is known to increase risks of skin cancer&#8221;, or something along those lines. Be sure to double-check the sources though to make sure it is from a reputable source and not sponsored from the company&#8217;s internal research team. Like, the Corn Refiners Association says high fructose corn syrup is okay&#8230;but we&#8217;re not idiots, we know otherwise. And honestly, as my dermatologist recently told me, odds are you can find health-friendly products within a reasonable price range at your local drugstore&#8211;big brand names or boutique-esque lines typically just add extra decorative detail and frilly bows on the packaging to make you think that you&#8217;re getting something safer and better than any drugstore could ever provide. Also, think about it&#8211;just because one lotion is full of ingredients you can&#8217;t even pronounce costs $2 less than one that is known to be promising, is saving that $2 really all that more important to you, or is your health? Sure, the extra dollar or two here and there will add up, but all it really means is you&#8217;ll just have to hold off on getting that box of Franzia for another week.</p>
