<p>Preparing the final design for presentation was a flurry. The week before E-days, the Social Robotics Platform team had the great opportunity to present a demo for Respite Care. This was an amazing time where all the feedback from clinicians rang very positively. Several forms of input that was given before consisted of adding certain games and motions to the design. Also, the addition of a Wii Nunchuk was suggested by a team member and raised to a high level of importance for the final design. Finally, several aesthetic things were suggested. For example, the LCD was placed in the rear, along with most of the electronics. Also, handles were a suggested addition which proved to be very simple to add. Overall, the design concept stayed the same, but several minor items were adjusted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As E-days neared, the creation of an instruction manual and a Bill of Materials (BOM) was created to aid in the presentation of the platform.</p>
<p>E-days was a spectacular experience. Our booth was constantly surround by people of all ages who were interested in many different facets of our project, such as the psychological and behavioral aspects all the way to the mechanisms of operation and manufacture. With such a diverse team, we were able to answer just about any questions that came at us and were very successful in conveying the purpose of the project and the potential that it had to revolutionize aspects of social rehabilitation, teaching ideas behind control, and practicing motor skills. The success of E-days can be supported by the 2<sup>nd</sup> place finish of the Social Robotics Platform in the college of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each team member was very excited about the project. The following are quotes from the team.</p>
<p>Adam Kattnig states, “My favorite part was hearing about the kid’s reactions to the platform when we first brought it in. It made the whole thing worth it.” Adam will be an intern at Arrow Electronics for the summer and is looking for full time employment after.</p>
<p>Melissa Wirtz states, “I have to agree with Adam. Seeing the potential it had for kids was incredible. I also enjoyed watch all the parts come together in the end to create a functional product.” Melissa landed a job at National Instruments (starting in the fall) and plans on traveling over the summer.</p>
<p>Tessa Alford states, “I loved working with such talented people with different backgrounds and making an impact while doing so.” Tessa will continue working for Genesis Engineering Solutions LLC and plans on traveling through the summer.</p>
<p>Josh Krokowski states, “My favorite parts would have to be going to Respite Care and seeing that our project was really making a difference and learning the incredible capabilities of 3D printing. Josh plans on traveling before searching for work.</p>
<p>Meng Koh States, “I loved the interdisciplinary aspect of this project and the need for a large amount of support and collaboration. Also, I couldn’t help but be excited when the kids were having so much fun; I love playing with them!” Meng plans on traveling before searching for work in applied robotics.</p>
<p>The process of this project began with a recognized need, as discussed in previous blogs. After a long period of concept development, many prototypes were built to create a final design.</p>
<p>Although we are extremely proud of our project, we hope that efforts and developments with it will continue. We think that our project could be improved in several areas. The sound outputted is very soft and externally powered speakers could be integrated. Also, efforts could be made to diversify input types; for example, perhaps a camera could be used to take input. With different types of inputs, more games could be created. Lastly, in order to operate as envisioned, rotation performance should be improved. The team thinks this could be done by moving the magnets further apart (perhaps twice the distance that they are currently at).</p>
<p>We are very pleased with how our project turned out. We are grateful for our advisor Dr. Maciejewski and coordinator Ms. Notaros. We would also like to thank Anschutz Medical Campus and Respite Care for collaborating with us.</p>

						<p>E-days was a stressful event. The preparation leading up to the event of making our poster and finalizing our results was already difficult, made more so by the fact that the rough draft of our 40 page design presentation paper was due the following Monday and competed with the poster’s attention. Nevertheless, we made it through and it went well!</p>
<p>We were unfortunate to not have had anybody stop by our booth before the judges came through. If we had we might have been clearer on what was important to talk about and what we could have glazed over. This might have impressed the judges more but happily nobody was too heartbroken to not have won an award.</p>
<p>We tried to only have 2-3 people “on the floor”. More than that would have probably led to competing voices in the presentation to passersbys which would have undermined the other presenter and made it less professional. This approach was a great decision. Those that might have been feeling uncomfortable with how entirely they knew the project before E-days surely knows all the ins and outs of the project.</p>
<p>The photo below luckily shows not only our group but our poster and models. We prepared a trifold containing all of the content of the project. Models were used to explain the different layers on the lens and how the interpenetrating network works. We were also fortunate to have copies of our paper during E-days.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1600.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-395" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1600-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_1600" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Bill’s favorite part of the project had to do with E-days. Bill said he enjoyed “the interaction with fellow students working on our major design” as we were placed right next to our peers that we have been working with for four years.</p>
<p>Ben, however, simply enjoyed putting together the poster, saying “making the poster and realizing we’re actually done with the biggest part of our senior year felt amazing!” Molly similarly enjoyed “piecing together the huge amount of information we’ve gathered and learned in just three months to present in a paper. I then realized how much we’ve accomplished.”</p>
<p>Evan really enjoyed the process engineering aspect of our project, he said “coming up with innovative ways to refine our process was fun, like trying to solve a puzzle.” Ravinder also enjoyed “constructing the layout of the HA integration process”.</p>
<p>Ahmed’s favorite part was the end, saying “the moment we came up with actual costs was the moment I felt like an engineer. The best part however was working with such a smart team! It was wonderful!”</p>
<p>We’ve all been truly blessed with such a wonderful team and project to work with as our culminating piece of our college career.</p>
<p>Though E-days is definitely not the end of our project—we still have to finish the paper and give a final presentation to the chemical and biological engineering faculty—it does have a culminating feel to it. It begins the slow down to finals and graduation.</p>
<p>Many people in our group are continuing on to work in industry. Interests vary; Ben is interested in environmental consulting and water treatment design, Evan in process design and modeling. Ahmed wants to work in industry for a while before continuing on to pursue his graduate degree, Bill and Ravinder just look forward to the freedom that a career will bring. Molly is continuing on to get her master’s degree in education and will teach high school math and science.</p>
<p>Thanks for following us this semester!</p>

<p>As we prepared for E-Days last week, we took some time to make a miniature version of our project. This small plexiglass chamber was a good visual for those walking past our booth at the Senior Design Showcase. We connected two small pumps to the chamber (one on the inlet, one on the exhaust side) and a pressure gage so that we could show those attending how the pressure within the chamber will be regulated. This will also double as a test chamber for us; upon completion of the control system, we will do various tests with the mini chamber to ensure it is functioning as expected.</p>
<p>Since we couldn&#8217;t load up our big chamber and take it to the Showcase very easily, we wanted to make sure that those we spoke with had a good understanding of what our project truly is. In addition to the mini chamber, we took a small lobe blower, very similar in design to the one that will be in our overall system,  as well as one of the many cook stoves that may be used during the tests completed with the exposure facility upon completion.</p>
<p>We had a great time discussing our project with the judges and those who attended the Showcase. People seemed very interested and liked the fact that this project will be helping those in the developing world. We even won an award from the Biomedical Engineering department for our project and its focus!</p>
<p>Over the course of this year, we accomplished a lot; it&#8217;s amazing to take a step back and see all that we&#8217;ve done! After we figured out what we needed to do, we tackled designing the facility, the &#8220;guts&#8221; of it, and the control system. This second semester, we have really gotten our hands dirty (literally, there was a lot of dirt and grease to work with) with all the building. In addition to building, we&#8217;ve done various tests to ensure things work as expected. As we finish up the semester, we will compile all the information necessary for us to easily hand over the project to the lab we are working with.</p>
<p>After we hand over the project, Drs. John Volckens and Jennifer Peel will use this facility to conduct controlled human exposure studies to investigate acute, subclinical effects associated with pollution generated by a broad range of stove technologies. This project will investigate whether or not “improved cookstoves” will actually enhance human health. Results of this research will help direct the future focus of stove programs and provide valuable insight for those seeking to answer the question, “How clean is clean enough?” with regards to cookstoves. If you are interested in learning more about the study or the controlled human exposure facility, contact Dr. John Volckens at john.volckens@colostate.edu.</p>
<p>Thanks to Drs. John Volckens and Christian L&#8217;Orange for all their assistance on this project. It&#8217;s been a privilege to work with such great advisors and we hope this project can help bring exciting developments in the field of cookstove research! We hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed learning about our project and are excited to go out and change the world through engineering!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a little more information about each of our team members, enjoy!</p>
<p>Sally Runions:</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of working on the project was being in charge of the controls system myself, while working together with my team members to make sure my designs would work well and integrate properly with their parts of the project. It was a unique combination of working alone while still working as part of a team, and I enjoyed the challenge of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still finalizing my plans for after college right now. I would like to be working for a company helping to source and order electric and control components for manufacturing applications, or doing home energy audits and helping families in Fort Collins save money by cutting down their energy usage.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this project is how much freedom we have gotten for each of our individual parts. At the beginning of the year I was given a task (my individual part) and from there I have had the freedom to come up with my own ideas and bounce them off of advisers.</p>
<p>After graduation I will be working for Rockwell Automation as a Sales Engineer. As a new hire I will have to train for the first 6 months which will have me moving around to 5 different cities during that time. Part way through this training I will find out where my final location will be, and I could be in pretty much any of the 20 largest cities in the country.</p>
<p>Jake Butynski:</p>
<p>The importance of the research that will ultimately result from this project is invaluable. The number of lives that can be improved and the future generations that may be lucky enough to never have these concerns makes all the hard work worth it. I feel honored to have been given such a task and the responsibility to help engineer and construct this facility.</p>
<p>I have accepted an offer with SRAM which is one of the world&#8217;s largest bicycle components companies. I will be moving to Colorado Springs to pursue this career and joining a newly developed team of engineers working on high performance disc brakes for road bikes that will be in the in the next Tour de France as well as Olympics. One aspect of the company I hope to get very involved with is World Bicycle Relief which is an organization that works to empower people in developing countries such as Kenya by providing custom engineered bicycles that help get kids to school, create jobs and allow health workers greater range.</p>
<p>Jamie Urban:</p>
<p>The best part of this project was getting to use my engineering background to develop something that can impact and help so many people around the world. I absolutely love that this project can help improve the lives of those who otherwise might not get help. That makes it all worth it!</p>
<p>After graduation, I will travel for part of the summer (yay, Europe!) and then spend time with my family before I head to New Delhi, India to spend the fall interning with Engineering Ministries International (EMI). EMI is a Christian ministry that combines peoples&#8217; technical skills with their passion to go out and share the love of Christ with the world. EMI teams up with Christian workers, pastors and other non-profits in developing countries and designs facilities (i.e. schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) that directly impact the communities they are in. I am so excited to get to go and work with EMI and cannot wait to see where God takes me through this opportunity!</p>

<p>The nature of land development is time driven.  To meet the 2018 completion date, the City of Thornton is moving forward with Regional Rail Partners, a design-build contractor for the project.  We hope that the City will see our design as a creative and realistic solution to meet the site and off-site changes specified for the 88<sup>th</sup> Avenue station site.</p>
<p>The following are experiences gained from the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>The importance of good communication among team members and your client.</li>
<li>Foster a respectful and positive group dynamic.</li>
<li>Maximize the strengths of each team member.</li>
<li>Pace yourself and the work to be completed.</li>
<li>Have a clear understanding of the project purpose and objectives to guide your work.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to reach out for help or clarification.</li>
<li>AutoCAD Civil 3D skills!</li>

<p>In preparation of E-Days, my team and I spent most of our time making and perfecting our poster.  Since our project does not include a prototype, we needed to find the best way to clearly and accurately display every aspect of our project.</p>
<p>We were the first group from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering to be visited by the judges.  We spent about ten minutes presenting our project and another fifteen minutes answering questions.  It went smoothly and helped us think about everything we needed to make sure was included in our final report.  In addition to completing our final report, we will be giving a presentation to the faculty of our department before the school year comes to an end.</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>When we first began our project in January, we decided on the production of lactic acid due to the growing global market for it, primarily driven by biodegradable plastic production.  The four of us initially planned on focusing on the downstream purification of our product as opposed to the upstream fermentation.  However, based on literature and patent research, we soon found out that the fermentation aspect would be more extensive than the separation and purification steps.  From this point on we shifted our focus and went about choosing a microorganism to perform the fermentation.  Since it was not realistic in the time we had to do experimental work regarding the fermentation, we decided to model data in published academic papers.  This involved using model equations for changes in biomass, glucose, and lactic acid over time.</p>
<p>Once the fermenter was sized and we accounted for the time it would take to grow enough cells, a rotation of batch fermenters was combined with a continuous downstream purification process.  This downstream process was modeled after a Cargill patent.  The last step was performing an economic analysis.  This turned out to be very challenging due to proprietary prices and a lack of commercial-scale prices.  In the end our growth media was an enormous cost and pushed our process towards being uneconomical.  To remedy this, we plan on contacting the company Genentech to get an idea of the difference in lab-scale and commercial-scale prices.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>Although it was a group effort, we all specialized in and enjoyed different aspects of the project.  Julia found the model work most rewarding; it was a big breakthrough when we finally got the model to match experimental data from literature.  Colleen had an appreciation for the big picture.  She enjoyed applying concepts from individual courses and putting them together to create a real-life process.  Kristy’s favorite part was experiencing how research connects to real, commercial processes.  I enjoyed exploring optimization proposals.  These come in many forms and I leanred there is always an improvement to be made or a more efficient way of reaching your final goal.</p>
<p>The four of us have not finalized our plans after graduation.  Julia plans on pursuing a technical sales position in engineering.  Colleen and Kristy plan on working as chemical engineers in the oil and gas/energy industries.  I am currently pursuing a process engineering or consulting role in the oil and gas and/or chemical industries.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Amperometric Microfluidic Device With Incorporated Tissue Slide For Personalized Cancer</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_433" style="width: 444px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-433" style="line-height: 1.5;" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BME-1.bmp" alt="BME 1" width="434" height="358" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Nicole Puissant, Alison Bailey, Blair Larson, Ilya Merkulovich</p></div>
<p>As the second leading cause of death in the United States, cancer demands a need for effective treatment strategies. Common cancer treatment options include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is capable of addressing cases of metastasis when cancer spreads throughout a patient&#8217;s body through venues including the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Unfortunately, current methods utilize models which act as predictive indicators of average systems, offering a &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; without the ability to address patient-specific drug interactions. Current methods of personalized cancer treatment are not reasonable due to time, effort, and money. This study aims to address personalized treatment limitations by engineering a microfluidic device capable of screening for individualized chemotherapy treatments. The device will deliver drug cocktails to biopsy tissue inserted within the device while simultaneously analyzing drug efficacy against both cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. Microfluidic research has gained popularity in recent years due its advantage of high experimental precision compared to conventional cell cultures; recent studies have demonstrated successful incorporation of tissue slices and control of their microenvironments. While the most common method for tracking cellular behavior relies on microscopy, alternative methods based on microfluidics would enhance the ability to provide direct, real-time feedback on drug efficacy. Amperometry has been used to detect release of chemicals, such as neurotransmitters and catecholamines, from mouse and rat tissue slices and have shown to measure concentrations within 5% accuracy. Furthermore, microfluidics has demonstrated utilization of enzymatic reactions to selectively detect concentrations of cancerous markers such as lactate and glucose in solution. In addition, design of a microfluidic device capable of delivering drugs to patient tissue and assessing their respective efficacies via measured am-perometric signals introduces the potential for improved personalization of cancer treatment to offer patients a greater chance of life.</p>

<p>Ulcerative colitis is a disease of the mucosa layer of the large intestine that causes lesions to appear on the inner walls. These lesions can be very irritable and painful to those suffering from the disease, and if untreated, will almost always lead to colon cancer. Current treatments of ulcerative colitis are invasive and can lead to irreparable damage, so this project aims to treat ulcerative colitis in adults in a much more con-trolled and less damaging way before the disease can become cancerous and therefore improve quality and length of life. This will be done by ablating the mucosa lining of the colon using argon gas as a plasma electrode, a process known as argon plasma ablation (APC). This project is sponsored by Covidien, a company that specializes in electrosurgical medical devices.<br />
The design objectives for this project included the development and construction of two argon plasma ablation devices: one with a forward, axially firing nozzle and the other with a side, perpendicu-larly firing nozzle. These two prototype designs were tested for ablation depth accuracy based on a variety of design parameters. In both devices, gas travels through a catheter tube, brass collar, polyimide tube, and out a ceramic nozzle past a tungsten wire electrode. The energized wire electrode drives current through the argon gas, which then carries electrons to the tissue to perform electrosurgery on the ulcer sites in the colon. Both prototypes have similar form and function, with different nozzle designs specific for different surgical applications or user preferences. Our testing data is to be a proof of concept that will determine if we can truly have controlled burn depth using this technology.</p>

<p>Cellular lysis, or the rupture of cellular membranes, is integral in a number of research and industrial applications. In proteomics and genomics, cell lysis is fundamental in the recovery of various cellular components required for continual research and experimentation.<br />
The process of cellular lysis generally employs mechanical, chemical, or electrical forces to rupture cell membranes. This disruption of cellular structure makes the intracellular components accessible for collection and further study. However, current cell lysing techniques remain inefficient, inexact, and time-consuming. Researchers are often forced to prioritize sensitivity or processing volume in lysing processes. Developing a streamlined process for cellular lysis, delivering in both protein yield and large volume capacity, has the potential to increase productivity while reducing cost and time requirements for researchers.<br />
This design project focuses on the development a flow-through cellular lysis device that minimizes human involvement and handles larger volumes of cellular medium with the sensitivity of smaller-scale operations. This device is part of a larger system which will culture and lyse E. coli prior to harvesting intracellular proteins. This automated, large-capacity, cell-lysing device will provide efficient and repeatable yields of viable cellular components.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to perform an alternative analysis, and then final design, on how to relocate a section of Bradley Road, which is a major thoroughfare that will be displaced by the construction of the Upper Williams Creek Reservoir scheduled to occur during Phase II of the Southern Delivery System (SDS). The SDS is a regional water delivery project designed to provide a safe and secure water distribution network for Colorado Springs and its surrounding communities. Additionally, Bradley Road is a Defense Access Road (DAR) for Schriever Air Force Base, and at no time, and under no circumstances, may this road be closed or detoured. Three alternatives were considered for this project including a road re-route to the north side of the reservoir and two separate bridge designs proposed to span the reservoir at different locations. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis was then developed to determine a preferred alternative to best meet the needs of the client with consideration to factors such as: cost, DAR requirements, environmental impacts, land access, impacts to commuter traffic, future reservoir impacts with respect to safe drinking water and recreational access, and any impacts to utilities in the area. The preferred alternative was then finalized to ensure that all design criteria and safety considerations met necessary requirements for an infrastructure project of this magnitude. Ultimately, the relocation of Bradley Road will provide a safe and efficient means of transportation to meet the needs of the communities affected by the filling of the Upper Williams Creek Reservoir.</p>

<p>In 2008 the Fort Collins City Council directed the Stormwater Utility to begin addressing stormwater quality and stream rehabilitation in Fort Collins. The program has since identified several potential stream restoration projects in an effort to protect the City’s watersheds and to preserve the natural functions of its floodplains. In collaboration with this program, Ram Restoration Consulting has been asked to provide the City with a preliminary design of stream stability measures and an aquatic habitat restoration plan for a reach of Mail Creek located upstream of Mead-ow Passaway Drive and downstream of the Fairway Dam. Like many waterways in the City, Mail Creek has been subject to long duration, high intensity flows of irrigation water since the early 1960’s. As a result, the stream channel has become severely degraded over time, experiencing severe vertical and lateral erosion, especially where banks exceed critical bank height. Additionally, the Mail Creek drainage basin has experienced a significant increase in development over the last decade, which has amplified surface irrigation and stormwater runoff. These changes contribute to the shallow groundwater table, which in turn contributes to base flow and further erosion of channel banks. Another consequence of these increased flows has been the overall degradation of aquatic habitat health and connectivity. Greater sinuosity and vertical erosion have majorly reduced the quality of the ecosystem as the reach continues to become more laterally disconnected. The objective of this project is to develop a preliminary design of the Mail Creek stream reach to improve the stability of the stream banks while enhancing the stream’s lateral and longitudinal connectivity. Such a design will focus on facilitating fish passage, improving the general health of the ecosystem and increasing water quality.</p>

<div id="attachment_438" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CIV-3.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-438" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CIV-3.bmp" alt="Group Members: Alyssa Kaspersen, Henry Pobur-ka, Evan Hoatson, Dorian Lainel, Sam Lassard, Santi-ago Velasquez" width="298" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Alyssa Kaspersen, Henry Pobur-ka, Evan Hoatson, Dorian Lainel, Sam Lassard, Santiago Velasquez</p></div>
<p>Ninjaneer Bridge Design (NBD), teamed with the Colorado State University chapter of ASCE, is taking part in the annual Student Steel Bridge Competition hosted by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). Each year, teams are provided with a mock scenario for which the bridges must be designed. In the current competition it is required that teams design and construct a 1:10 scale model of a bridge for the President of Kupicra to span the Nogo River so that his capital city is connected to the surrounding villages during the rainy season. Sonarpin Foundation, the funders of the project, require use of specially sized, light-weight, prefabricated steel members which can be transported to the construction site via ox cart and be constructed before the annual rainy season begins. Footings, deck panels, and causeways will be constructed by local crews and do not need to be considered in the design. Along with this realistic scenario, ASCE provides restrictions for the bridge and individual members, including size and weight limitations which must be met during competition. At competition, bridges are judged based on durability, constructability, usability, stiffness, construction speed, efficiency, economy, and attractiveness. With the competition in mind, NBD’s objective throughout the year has been to design and fabricate the most cost effective and appropriate bridge to fit the demands provided by the ASCE rules and regulations. To meet this objective, NBD worked with Colorado State University’s ASCE chapter to find sponsors to fund the project, model multiple scenarios in AutoCAD, simulate the proposed loading scenarios in SAP2000 in order to optimize weight and member sizes, and then fabricate the bridge in an on-campus mill. The project came to fruition at the Rocky Mountain Regional Student Steel Bridge Competition this spring in Albuquerque, NM.</p>

<p>Sensory substitution is the use of stimuli to one sensory organ, to supplement or replace another. Sensory substitution has practical applications in the health, entertainment, and the defense industries. The use of the tongue as a target for sensory substitution is of particular interest, because of the high density of innervated general and special sensation fibers. Electrical stimulation of the tongue can be used as a sensory substitute for hearing. However the dynamic range, the ability to use this sensory mode to discern the type, direction, and magnitude of a sound, falls short of what the human ear is capable of. The use of chemical and thermal stimuli can increase the dynamic range and allows the tongue to function as a substitute or supplement for the ear. Special visceral afferent nerves (SVAN) are able to detect different tastes based on chemical composition. Sound can be transduced to a taste sensation to further improve the dynamic range of the tongue as a mode of sensory substitution. Human saliva is 99% water, and with the use of electrolysis it produces acidic hydronium ions. Control of the hydronium ion concentration allows for localized and discrete taste sensations. These sensations induced by transduction of a sound input increase the dynamic range of the tongue. Likewise, localized thermal sensations can further increase this dynamic range. The combined effect of electrical, chemical, and thermal stimulation allows the tongue to function as a sensory substitute for hearing.</p>

<p>Biomass gasification is a process that converts the energy on organic material into a fuel (gas) mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, often referred to as Syngas. Syngas, when produced correctly, is often far more efficient than combusting the original organic material and has a very broad range of applications. The problem with Syngas production is that, currently, it is an expensive process and is not cost effective. It uses more energy to convert the organic material into fuel than it saves. This group intends to tackle this problem using a variety of natural, abundant resources to design and model a large scale biomass gasification process in a cost effective and efficient manner.</p>

<p>Protein crystals have numerous applications in Bioengineering across several disciplines, from applications in small-scale drug delivery to those in biosensors and micro-scale detection systems. Within this realm of Bioengineering via proteins, our group has chosen to explore the creation and testing of conductive nanotubes and nanowires within the pores of protein crystals. This was done by cross-linking, oxidizing, and pyrrole-soaking prepared protein crystals. Cross-linking by use of glutar-aldehyde or formaldehyde is utilized to strengthen the protein crystals to the point where they can be manipulated effectively. Oxidation creates free radicals within the crystals, which allows the pyrrole to polymerize into polypyrrole, an organic polymer which has been proven to provide conductance. This process allows for the creation of conductive protein crystals. Our crystals have been made to be conductive per the mentioned procedure, and tested as such, using Bioengineering and Electrochemical methods developed specifically for this project. Addition-ally, Electron Microscopy images have been taken to prove our theory that nanowires and nanotubes were created within the crystal pores.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Robotics Challenge</h3>
<div id="attachment_443" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ECE-1.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-443" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ECE-1.bmp" alt="Group Members: Brandy Liptak, Daniel Garcia, Mason Swarr, Shaun Holland, Myles O'Reilly" width="633" height="380" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Brandy Liptak, Daniel Garcia, Mason Swarr, Shaun Holland, Myles O&#8217;Reilly</p></div>
<p>Due to potentially hazardous environments and prohibitive travel time of manned space missions, robotic explorers are preferred for preliminary planetary explorations. These robots must be autonomous so they can effectively work at the vast distances between Earth and extraterrestrial bodies. Thus, the mechanical system, electrical hardware, and software must be thoroughly designed and rigorously tested before being put into the field. The cost of launching an exploratory mission causes scientists to err on the side of caution when selecting desired paths for a robot to explore. This limits the places the explorer can go as well as potentially adds a great deal of time to the expedition.<br />
The project’s main goal is to create a 3-D printed robot that is capable of traversing rough terrain toward a navigational bea-con i.e. being able to climb over objects in its path rather than going around them when possible, otherwise navigating around them and returning to a desired course. This will take great effort, both on the mechanical system as well as the electrical hardware and software systems. The robot will be participating in the Robotics Challenge, an event sponsored by NASA and the Colorado Space Grant Consortium which seeks to spur interest and ideas in the design of autonomous robots for space exploration.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Social Robotics Platform</h3>
<div id="attachment_444" style="width: 455px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ECE-2.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-444" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ECE-2.bmp" alt="Group Members: Meng Koh, Melissa Wirtz, Adam Kattnig, Josh Krokowski, Tessa Alford" width="445" height="267" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Meng Koh, Melissa Wirtz, Adam Kattnig, Josh Krokowski, Tessa Alford</p></div>
<p>The Social Robotics Platform project moves a toy sitting on a platform in order to engage children with developmental disabilities. These children often do not understand that their actions affect their environment. The purpose of this platform is to help these children develop motor skills and prevent a condition of “learned helplessness” by providing an engaging system that responds to their input.<br />
This interdisciplinary project is being tackled by five engineering students from CSU working in partnership with Anschutz Medical Campus (Denver) and Respite Care (Fort Collins).<br />
The final platform design was to detect input from the patient and respond adequately. The patient will activate a capability switch for input (such as a button), and the Microcontroller Unit (MCU) will then process the input signal. Depending on the mode of operation, a movement, along with lights and sounds, will be generated by the MCU and the motion system. In this way, the child will see the toy on the platform respond to his or her action.<br />
This project requires many custom-made parts and the integration and interfacing of many components. The team used various methods to create mechanical parts and casing parts. One of these methods involves 3D printing. Also, circuitry was designed to drive motors and integrate inputs, sounds, and lights; and software was developed to control an Arduino, which ultimately controls the entire system.<br />
There is no perfect replacement for a professional therapist. However, providing a fun, portable, and engaging tool that enables children to continually progress in the development of motor-skills and understanding control (even in the absence of a therapist) is invaluable.</p>

<p>As airborne electronics become more popular, technology must be created to allow for better performance and operation of these machines. This is the idea behind the HexArray project. This team is responsible for the design, implementation, and analysis of a base station which will be used to transmit electromagnetic signals to various robotic devices within a specified range. This is achieved using various antennas that are strategically placed to communicate with mechanisms in the range. Extensive knowledge of antenna design and analysis, radio frequency applications, and manufacturing work were required for completion of this project.<br />
This project is important because of the diversity of its applications. Streaming video from airborne electronics is very beneficial to a variety of practices. For example, firefighters in the near future could have a drone armed with a camera to quickly and safely oversee a burning building. The HexArray would simply need to be placed near the building (perhaps mounted on the firetruck) to give the firefighters a high quality live feed of a dangerous area. This product aims to be much more affordable than current solutions on the market.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Aerowings</h3>
<div id="attachment_447" style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-1.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-447" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-1.bmp" alt="Group Members: Tyler Hupp, Christopher Kodey, Anthony Mazzola, Joshua Pitel" width="675" height="506" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Tyler Hupp, Christopher Kodey, Anthony Mazzola, Joshua Pitel</p></div>
<p>The trucking industry plays a huge role in the modern economy. Near-ly 70% of all goods are transported on semi-trucks. With roughly two million semi-trucks in use today, a huge amount of diesel fuel is used for this industry. The leading cause of low fuel mileage for a tractor- trailer is aerodynamic drag. At highway speeds, approximately 65% of a truck&#8217;s power is used to overcome aerodynamic drag. There have been many attempts to reduce drag within the trucking industry on many different areas of the tractor-trailer. The Aerowings team has focused their efforts on the gap between the tractor and trailer. This area of low pressure turbulence creates a large amount of suction drag on the vehicle. Our sponsor was issued a patent, therefore the Aerowings team goal was to build a device in accordance with U.S. patent no. 8075046 and quantify the effect it has on the aerodynamic drag of a tractor-trailer system. The patent states that the device must be autonomous and operate between an open and closed position between the tractor and trailer with two sides working independently from each other. The autonomous and independent actuation was accomplished using vehicle speed, wind speed and wind direction sensors attached to a pneumatic system. The testing was performed using CFD modeling and an SAE coast down test.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Continuous Electric Field Assisted Sintering</h3>
<div id="attachment_448" style="width: 499px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-2.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-448" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-2.bmp" alt="Group Members: Clint Cass, Rex Schlosser, Patrick McFarling, Sydney Drotar" width="489" height="276" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Members: Clint Cass, Rex Schlosser, Patrick McFarling, Sydney Drotar</p></div>
<p>Materials that take advantage of the unique properties available through sintering are finding their way into more and more every-day devices. For metals this is a relatively straight forward adaption of current technologies but for ceramics this presents challenges. The sintering methods able to make fully densified ceramics are slow batch processes that result in highly expensive materials and are difficult to manufacture. The need is then apparent for a process capable of generating fully densified materials regardless of their composition in a continuous manner. This specific prototype produces continuous samples of zinc oxide with a densification similar to those samples created with the existing manufacturing process, called Spark Plasma Sintering. Improvements not only include larger sample sizes, but the entire system exhibits a reduction in the power consumption and cycle time per unit of produced material. Our material of zinc oxide is simply the start of the capabilities of this brand new manufacturing process. The ramifications of this technology will be far reaching as it becomes possible to convert a slow batch process into a continuous production line in which a hopper filled with nano-powdered materials feeds a Continuous Electric Field Assisted Sintering machine. This therefore broadens the use of ceramics with unique properties in the manufacturing world.</p>
<h3>3. BP Noise Mitigation</h3>
<div id="attachment_449" style="width: 201px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-3.bmp"><img class=" wp-image-449" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ME-3.bmp" alt="Group members: Brad Bonavida, Kayvon Torandaz, Deider Barrick, Tyler Hudson" width="191" height="286" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group members: Brad Bonavida, Kayvon Torandaz, Deider Barrick, Tyler Hudson</p></div>
<p>British Petroleum has hundreds of natural gas compressors in the San Juan Basin area of Colorado. The increase in well numbers in addition to growing populations means that well sites and residents’ homes are coming into closer contact with one another. It has become a major priority of BP to keep the noise levels of these compressors low, so that they can continue to be a good neighbor to the people of Colorado and stay within the legal noise regulations set by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. Current industry solutions include full or partial sound walls, mufflers, and noise attenuating enclosures. All of these solutions can be expensive and also hazardous due to the potential confinement of a highly flammable substance. Therefore, the demand for a less hazardous and less expensive noise mitigation solution has substantially increased.<br />
The concept of active noise cancellation, which is executed through the destructive interference of two similar sound waves acting 180 degrees out of phase from one another, is an idea that could unlock a promising new solution to the mitigation of the unwanted compressor noise. The purpose of the BP Noise Mitigation Team was to design an alpha prototype active noise cancellation system that could give BP some initial insight into the feasibility of using this technique to reach a reasonable noise level on their compressors. The research of this team through the senior design project is a crucial step in British Petroleum’s pursuit to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.</p>

Last Friday, we attended the Senior Design Showcase as part of Engineering Days, and it was quite a success.</p>
<p>At the event, we had a laptop running our LabVIEW program in real time using data from a meter on campus. (Unfortunately, the meter website was not working during our presentation to the judges. We were very thankful that we had recorded a video of the simulation in case something like that happened.) We also demonstrated the program using our simulated test data to show the metrics failing.</p>
<p>We had another laptop with our project website and this blog for people to learn more about our project. We also had copies of our AutoHotkey code and user manual for more technical detail. Finally, we displayed a tri-fold poster to give an overview of our project.</p>
<p>Our team enjoyed talking with the people who visited our table. We put a lot of effort into this project, so we were excited to share our accomplishments. Our audience varied from elementary school students to experts in the field of power engineering, so we had to adjust our presentation accordingly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Check out our team reflections on the event and share our plans for after graduation:</p>
<p><strong>Brian Brigandi</strong>: “My favorite part about working on this project was getting to know our team. We became very good at completing tasks on our own as well as working on things as a team. This project flew by.</p>
<p>After graduation on May 15<sup>th</sup>, I hope to find a job in the utility industry in the Colorado area.”</p>
<p><strong>Mark Joseph</strong>: “My favorite part of the senior design project was having the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment once the project was complete. It took a whole year to complete, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>I plan to move to Denver, Colorado upon my graduation. I will spend the summer traveling, integrating into post-college life, and playing volleyball. In early fall I will start work for Northrop Grumman as a Test and Integration Engineer. I look forward to applying all that I learned throughout my time at Colorado State University at Northrop Grumman.”</p>
<p><strong>John Sisk</strong>: “My favorite part about this senior design project was taking what someone else has already done and adding onto it in order to make it a better product. As an engineer it is essential to be able to take what&#8217;s already given and use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>I plan on continuing my career as an engineer in the electrical power industry.”</p>
<p><strong>Olivia Trinko</strong>: “My favorite part of working on the project was the sense of accomplishment it gave me. It was so rewarding to plan out the project and then make it come to life. Although the obstacles we ran into were frustrating, overcoming them as a team made the effort worth it.</p>
<p>After graduation, I am moving to the Bay Area to work for Pacific Gas and Electric. I will be a part of their Engineering Rotational Development Program, where I will have three different jobs for six months each to gain experience with the company before deciding on a permanent position.”</p>
<p>Looking back at our project, we accomplished three main goals. First, we researched power quality meters and learned LabVIEW software. Then, we automated the process of getting data from a power quality meter and feeding it into the LabVIEW program. For this, we had to experiment with different brands of power quality meters and methods of accessing the meter data. To automate the process, we wrote an AutoHotkey code. Finally, we updated the LabVIEW program and tested the results. We had to make simulated test data since the data from the power quality meters were of high power quality and would not set off alarms.</p>
<p>We hope that our project will continue with another senior design team. The program could be updated to work with any power quality meter to make it a universal power quality monitor. The team could also implement the program as a smart phone application for mobile use. They could even add more power quality metrics to the program to make it more robust. These are just some of the ideas we have brainstormed, but this project could take many different paths in the future.</p>
<p>Our senior design team would like to thank you all for following our blog posts as we have progressed on our project! We would like to also thank our adviser, Dr. Suryanarayanan, for his guidance throughout our project as well as the ECE Department and Energy Institute at CSU for the academic support and Schneider Electric and Fort Collins Utilities for their input from an industry viewpoint.</p>

A lot of time and effort has been put into this project and it was nice to share our hard work with family members, judges, industry sponsors, peers, and students in middle school and high school. In order to represent the team at E-days we all wore matching shirts that allowed us to be recognized as a part of the Henry lab. We compiled a poster that summarized all of the results and methods that were performed, a TV that contained a slideshow of images, microfluidic devices that people could interact with, as well as a differential flow device that was running on the table. The layout of our presentation can be seen below:</p>
<p>After the showcase was complete we were invited to the awards ceremony later that night where little did we know we would be receiving first place in Biomedical Engineering:</p>
<p>I am extremely proud of this team and we would not have made it to where we are today if it wasn’t for everyone’s individual contributions. I truly loved the mix of majors within the group, because we each brought a unique ideas to the project. This quote pretty much summarizes the bond that we all built as a group throughout the process: “even if we aren’t number one, you all are number one in my heart”. This truly was an amazing experience in our senior year and I feel very lucky to have worked with these 3 amazing engineers. Each of the members have written about their favorite part of the project, as well as their plans for post-graduation:</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alison Bailey</strong>: “I’d say first and foremost that my favorite part of the project was working with such a great team! In terms of the project itself, I was most excited about the dye experiment we performed on our differential flow device to compare the flow in our actual system to modeling predictions – watching the blue and red streams flow side by side in our main channel and retain their original colors without mixing was really neat. Overall, I loved the many opportunities for learning and creative problem solving we encountered over the course of this design project. As for post-graduation plans I am looking into going on a post-graduation adventure trip abroad shortly after graduating, and am currently in the process of interviewing with a few companies for biomedical engineering positions starting this summer or early fall.”</p>
<p><strong>Blair Larson</strong>: “My favorite thing about working on our senior design project was being able to share our results at E-days. After working hard all semester it was exciting to present everything we accomplished and people seemed really excited about the results we achieved. After graduation I will start an internship at Terumo BCT in Lakewood, Colorado working with both the software systems team and the research and development team.”</p>
<p><strong>Ilya Merkulovich</strong>: “It was really rewarding to be one of the first groups to try to develop a specific technology. Though we did not get as far as we would have liked, we demonstrated that live tissue biological analyte detection in a microfluidic device was not only possible, but a promising technique and I am very excited to see its further development. As for plans after graduation, I am currently in the process of interviewing for a few biomedical engineering positions.”</p>
<p><strong>Nicole Puissant</strong>: “My favorite part of the project was the people that I got to work with, as well as presenting our results at E-days. I learned a lot about not only the project itself, but how to work on a team that is interdisciplinary. I feel like the most rewarding part of all was presenting our results and seeing the reaction from people about what we accomplished. It was great to work on a project that in the future could help to an individual that is struggling with cancer. As for after graduation, I plan to take a little bit of time off and will be going to Mexico with my family. Afterwards, I will be moving down to Lakewood, CO where I will be working for Terumo BCT.”</p>
<p>Overall, I would claim this project as a success. We definitely had to overcome many hurdles within the project, but if the solution was easy it wouldn’t be research. Throughout the entirety of the project we were able to obtain results for three major goals. The three goals that were accomplished throughout the project are as follows: detection of catecholamine release from a healthy adrenal tissue, detection of lactate as a biomarker for cell death, and to prove the concept of differential dosing within our device. We are not entirely sure what will happen with this project after graduation, but we believe that it will be continued within the Henry lab. This project can be taken many different directions and is definitely a viable option for a continued senior design project.</p>
<p>This was an incredible experience for all of us and it would not have been this amazing if it wasn’t for all of the amazing advisers and graduate students that we had on this project. We would like to acknowledge Dr. Chuck Henry, Dr. Stu Tobet, Dr. James C. Moore (MD) with the Front Range Cancer Specialists, Dr. Ellen Brennan-Pierce, Rachel Feeny, John Wydallis, Nicole Ramo, Stacy Willett, Chad Eitel, Luke Schwerdtfeger, and the support from the Henry and Tobet labs. We have officially made it through Engineering Days and are less than a month away from graduation and we are all very excited to see what the future holds!</p>

<p><strong>E-Days</strong></p>
<p>Well, we made it to the big day!  After finishing up the last bits of our modeling and analyzing, we compiled all the information on a massive tri-piece poster (4 feet by 8 feet!) using the awesome poster plotting printers in the Engineering building and were amazed to see our year-long project all on one board!  On the actual day of the showcase (Friday, April 17), we set up our board in the Lory Student Center ballroom with the other senior engineering groups and spent the day proudly explaining our project to everyone who stopped by.  We even had animations running to show some of the 2D modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>Our project started with the team doing a site visit to survey current conditions caused by the destruction of the 2013 flooding.  This survey data was then added into AutoCAD and became the base for our model designs.  From there, we began the design process by analyzing previous successful whitewater parks in urban areas and environmental impact studies.</p>
<p>In the 1D HEC RAS modeling program, we created two alternatives by adjusting original cross sectional geometries.  Cross section geometries were adjusted to create flow channels for conveying designated flow rates given by our sponsor company, S2o Design.  Low flow channels were designed to convey 30 to 200 cfs.  Medium flow channels were designed for 200 to 500 cfs.  High flow channels were designed for 500 to 1200 cfs.  Alternative 1 was created with symmetric cross sections, which is the traditional set up for manmade river channels.  Alternative 2 was made with asymmetric cross sections with the idea of keeping the cross sectional area the same, while altering the wetted perimeter.  Figure 1C shows the typical cross section of Alternative 1, while Figure 2C shows the plan view for Black Bear Hole.  Figure 3C is the typical cross section for Alternative 2, and Figure 4C is the plan view for Black Bear Hole.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure3C.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-375 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure3C-e1429548663357-1024x794.jpg" alt="Figure3C" width="1024" height="794" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3C</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure4C.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-376 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure4C-e1429548705795.jpg" alt="Figure4C" width="763" height="513" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4C</p>
<p>In HEC RAS, twelve flow level profiles were examined through both alternatives.  Flow levels to analyze were specified by S2o Design and included 30, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 cfs.  At each flow level, Froude numbers and velocities were used to analyze the quality of the hydraulic jumps.  In order to consider a wave good quality, Froude numbers needed to be between 1 and 2.  Velocities were checked to make sure water was actually in motion but were not analyzed for fish passage.</p>
<p>Alternative 1 showed the best waves in size and consistency both numerically with Froude numbers and visually.  Figure 5C shows the water surface elevations at the flow rate of 2000 cfs over Alternative 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure5C.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-377" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure5C-300x189.jpg" alt="Figure5C" width="300" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5C</p>
<p>Alternative 2 in HEC RAS had smaller waves and even showed washing out of the waves in some of the middle flow rates.  Although the Froude numbers and velocities in Alternative 2 fell within the desired range for a reliable wave, the waves created were small and would be considered mediocre for expert kayakers.  Figure 6C shows the water surface elevations at 2000 cfs for Alternative 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure6C.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-378" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure6C-300x189.jpg" alt="Figure6C" width="300" height="189" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 6C</p>
<p>Through the use of SRH2D, 2D modeling was made for both alternatives as well.  Again, twelve flow rates were analyzed and included 30, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 cfs.  SRH2D allowed us to analyze Froude numbers, flow velocities, and water depths.</p>
<p>Our conclusion from 1D modeling of Alternative 1 providing the best results was supported in 2D modeling.  Alternative 1 showed consistent waves forming over both holes, produced required velocities for proper fish passage, and had enough water depth to allow boats to do tricks and flips on the rapids.  Figure 7C shows Alternative 1 flow velocities at 2500 cfs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure7C.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure7C-1024x647.jpg" alt="Figure7C" width="1024" height="647" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 7C</p>
<p>Alternative 2 failed on almost all checks in 2D modeling.  Froude numbers were not consistent across the features to allow for reliable waves to occur, flow velocities were only large above Black Bear Hole and then did not increase again throughout the rest of the river, and flow flooded onto the highway.  Figure 8C shows the flow velocities at 2500 cfs for Alternative 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure8C.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-380 size-large" src="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/senior-design/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Figure8C-1024x646.jpg" alt="Figure8C" width="1024" height="646" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 8C</p>
<p>Overall, Alternative 1 proved to be the best design.  This goes to show that sometimes the traditional set up is still in use because it actually works!  With the implementation of this design on Black Bear Park in Lyons, CO, whitewater recreationalists will be very happy with the results and will be on the river whenever logical!</p>

<p><strong>Team Member Closing Thoughts and Future Plans</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Melissa James:</em></span> My favorite part of the project was having all the hands-on experience with a real-life project!  I loved all the real-world lessons we learned and the reality that not everything goes as planned, but together we can make it over any obstacle.  I will not be graduating until December.  I do have an internship lined up for the summer with MWH Global, a water resources company, and hope to get hired on full-time when I graduate.  I plan to work in industry for a couple years before going back to school to get a Master’s degree in Engineering Management.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Josh Wright:</em></span> My favorite part of the project was learning how to use the 1D flow modeling program, HEC RAS, from scratch.  Our team really came together to overcome one of our largest obstacles.  After college I plan on working full-time in the consulting field.  After a few years in the industry, I would like to take some time off and go on a ski tour through Canada.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Brian O’Donnell:</em></span> My favorite part of E-Days was being able to present our final product to all of the students and professors.  I felt like our project was unique, and it was satisfying to see so many people ask questions and to be able to explain to them what our objectives and findings were.  Additionally, being able to talk to and see all of the other amazing projects that other students had worked so hard on was great as well.  It really made me feel part of a strong academic community, and to finally be able to partake in this event after seeing so many great projects in the prior 3 years was very special!  After graduation, I am going to be working as a Civil Engineer 1 for Larimer County.  After an internship last summer and continuous part-time work throughout the year, I found that I greatly enjoy helping out this community and have gained much applicable construction experience doing so.  Larimer County has some of the nicest, most genuine employees I have ever worked with and the work I do with them always feels special because I know people will benefit from it.  With the Flood of 2013 causing so much damage, there is a lot of work to be done still, but I am excited to put my knowledge and skills from CSU to work.  I am extremely excited to be able to spend more time in Fort Collins and will always be a CSU Ram at heart!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>John Glover:</em></span> My favorite part of the project was learning and working with the SMS and SRH-2D software to create our 2D model. It has incredible capabilities that can be useful in so many ways. The fact that the user can overlay a satellite image over the data means that you are allowed to visually see what is occurring as far as water depth, elevation, Froude number, and flow velocity are concerned. You can also make videos showing different flows rates and what would occur in that situation.  Once I graduate, I plan on going on a sailing trip with some buddies for a couple weeks. Once I get back, I will be getting ready for my multi-month backpacking trip through Europe and Southeast Asia. I plan to start in the north and work my way down following the sun as it were. Once I get to Southeast Asia I plan on island hopping until I reach Australia and New Zealand. At which point, I hope to find work with an engineering firm.</p>

<p>Our team could not have gotten to this point or achieved all our objectives without the contributions of each team member.  I was lucky to work with 4 other amazing seniors who all brought unique talents to the group.  We have each written our favorite part of work on the project and our plans for post-graduation below.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caley Follmer – “I loved learning about new technology and working through challenges.  I think this project made me a more well-rounded engineer and I feel prepared to go out into industry.  I will be working for Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Littleton, CO”</p>
<p>Robert Harvey – “My favorite part of the project was working with people that I hadn&#8217;t worked with before. It was a great experience to see how different people solve problems.   I am moving near Seattle for a job in the nuclear industry.”</p>
<p>Eric Jones –“ My favorite part of the project was laying out the electronics so that they fit inside the housing.  It took a bit of measurement and wiring innovation to get it to fit, and I&#8217;m happy with how it turned out. I&#8217;ll keep living in Fort Collins looking for work.”</p>
<p>Adam Taufmann – &#8220;I liked getting to actually learn how to use 3D printers to create prototypes.  I&#8217;ve been doing this for a while with the internships that I&#8217;ve had, but I never actually took the process from CAD to a printed object by myself.  Now I can say that I have!  I&#8217;m moving to the Big Island of Hawaii and currently have a job with SolarCity in more of a sales position.”</p>
<p>Cody White – “I really enjoyed working on a real-life application of engineering with a very collaborative team. The EVSE project had very real implications within the green energy market, and it was really interesting to wrestle with the same problems that actual charger manufacturer&#8217;s face in producing these units.  I have gratefully accepted a position with Woodward Inc as a Technical Support Engineer in their Engine Systems group. I&#8217;ll be located in Loveland, Colorado, and I will be helping to support Woodward&#8217;s products all over the world while assisting in continuous improvement of our products.</p>
<p>I loved working through the entire process of this project.  From project planning to making design decisions, to prototyping and final assembly we were able to see the full engineering design process and really make it our own.  We are not quite sure what will happen with our project yet, however, in our opinion we would like to see if become a continued senior design project for next year.  We were able to create an alpha prototype and would love to see a team take our designs to the next level reducing cost even more by working with injection molding and other technologies.</p>
<p>Senior Design was an incredibly rewarding experience.  We put in many long hours and our fair share of blood, sweat, and tears; however, we can all stand proudly by what we have accomplished.  We have made it through this rite of passage and are all so excited for what the future has in store!</p>
