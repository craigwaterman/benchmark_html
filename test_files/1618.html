<p>The UThink Blog service has been retired.  This means that you will no longer be able to access UThink to administer blogs or view blogs.  The entire service has been shut down.  We are sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>UThink staff still have limited access to blog data and content. By request, a ZIP file copy can be provided of blog content, images, other media, and uploads. In addition, an <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/338">archive of UThink</a> has been created through the Internet Archiveâ€™s Archive-It service. </p>

<p>Redirect service is available. To redirect to another platform, users can send the URL of a UThink blog and the URL of the replacement blog to <a href="mailto:uthink@umn.edu">uthink@umn.edu</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on web publishing options at the University of Minnesota, please visit <a href="http://it.umn.edu/collaboration-web-content-services">Collaboration & Web Content Services</a>.</p>
