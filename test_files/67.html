And more importantly, the start of March Madness! I live for the NCAA basketball tournament. As usual, I filled out a bracket this year. You can see my picks HERE! Back to the task at hand\u2026I wanted to share my March Birchbox with you!  If you\u2019re not familiar with Birchbox, you can sign up and receive a box of 5 beauty samples for only $10\/month. I\u2019m usually not a huge fan of subscription boxes, because I usually end up with stuff I won\u2019t use. However, three boxes into 2016, and I\u2019m SUPER pleased with Birchbox. I highly recommend trying it! (you can cancel at anytime)  1 \/\/ 2 \/\/ 3 \/\/ 4 \/\/ 5 1: Amika dry shampoo\u2013as a true dry shampoo fanatic, this one makes my top 3 list. It smells great and works well to absorb oil! 2: theBalm Stainiac\u2013this lip\/cheek stain gives a sheer tint with just the right amount of color. \u201cDouble-duty\u201d beauty products are great to throw in your bag for work or school. 3: Trestique eye shadow crayon in \u201cAspen Pine\u201d\u2013the color of this eye shadow stick is gorgeous and makes my green eyes pop! The built-in smudge tip allows you to create a quick smoky eye. 4: FHI Hot Sauce heat-activated conditioner\u2013since I like to curl my hair with a super hot curling wand, I\u2019m excited to try this condition that will be activated in the presence of heat. 5: Wilma Schumann eye pads\u2013these 100% collagen eye pads are amazing.

As I\u2019m graduating in 2 months, I have been thinking a lot about life lately. I have some major goals that I would like to accomplish. Some of them are related to my profession, but some involve meeting people or seeing things. I really believe that it\u2019s important to write down your goals so that you can envision them happening (if that makes sense). Karli over at September F A R M is starting a new \u201c1o on Tuesday\u201d linkup, and I will be joining her today!  ONE. Graduate pharmacy school. Like I said, graduation is coming up on May 7th, and it has been such a long time coming! I have been in school for 10 years! 3 degrees later, I can\u2019t wait to be a practicing pharmacist. TWO.  Buy a house (or condo). Granted I am pleased with my job, I would like to put down roots and buy a place. I am more about the condo life, because I like to travel and definitely want someone to take care of my miniature yard ;) THREE. Maintain a successful blog. Being that I\u2019m finishing pharmacy school, my posts are sporadic to say the least. With that being said, after graduation I have the goal of posting at least 4 times\/week. FOUR. Become fluent in Spanish. This was one of my undergraduate majors. I can communicate well in the pharmacy\/medical setting, but I would like to become fluent in the language so I can communicate with anyone. FIVE. Write a lifestyle book. I would love to write a book giving tips to single girls who are extremely focused on a career in healthcare. There are several pointers I would like to offer, and I would also share some things I would do differently if I could. SIX. Become efficient with my Nikon. DSLR photography is very interesting to me, and I would love to know which lens to use when and which settings are best for which pictures. I would like to learn to photograph: the moon\/stars, lightning, and thunderstorms. SEVEN. Speaking of weather, I would like to go on a storm chase. Ever since I was 5, the Weather Channel has been my favorite. All of my friends \u0026 family know my obsession with weather, and I would love to see some severe storms up close. EIGHT. Travel to Bora Bora, Nevis, and Dubai. I have been fortunate to travel to Europe \u0026 China, and I enjoyed both of those experiences. I think the world has so many great lessons to teach us, and traveling allows us to explore them. NINE. Live in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is my dream city. If I have a free weekend, I\u2019m always trying to get down there. I will live there one day, so I can be within 5 minutes of shopping at North Park. TEN. Meet Jimmy Fallon. At the very least, I would like to attend a taping of the Tonight Show. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I have realized that laughter really is the best medicine. Jimmy never fails to disappoint! Be sure to head over to Karli\u2019s blog \u0026 link up your \u201c10 on Tuesday!\u201d You can blog about any 1o things of your choosing: life goals, funny stories, favorite nail polish colors, etc. The possibilities are endless! Have a great week!

I was contacted by Uncommon Goods and asked to check out their website. I was super excited for this opportunity, because I\u2019m graduating in 2 months and moving. It almost feels as if I\u2019m starting over and I have a pretty good idea of the direction I want to go with home decor. Why Uncommon Goods? I was attracted to this company for one reason: their story. As I have gotten older and traveled around to different parts of the world, I have seen that the environment and people often get taken for granted. I was so pleasantly happy to see a company that seeks to carry products that aren\u2019t harmful to the environment or people. Uncommon Goods is independently-owned, which was also a big plus to me. Entrepreneurship has always been quite appealing to me. For each purchase from their website, $1 will be donated to one of their not-for-profit partner organizations. I was drawn to the \u201cWomen for Women International\u201d organization. This provides war survivors and refugee women with the tools needed to establish a life of self-sufficiency. War has affected so many countries, and I believe this is a worthwhile cause. I have found several pieces I liked on the Uncommon Goods website. I am obsessed with white + gold as of late. I want my bedroom to feature all white bedding and be very clean-lined. I love having decorative accents that add to the style of a room. Find adorable accents here! (I LOVE these agate coasters!) I also am a big fan of wall art that makes a statement. Wall art prints can be found here.  I found this world map print that I love! (We all know I want to travel the world!) Since I do want all white bedding, some fun accent pillows would help my bedding look \u201cfinished.\u201d Check out this page for pillows\/throws to complete this look! Lastly, I was telling my grandparents the other day that I was looking to get some new furniture for my new place. I am thankful that I have been passed down several pieces that have been in the family, but I want to make my home feel like mine. Uncommon Goods has adorable furniture pieces here!  How adorable are these state side tables? You can pick your state here! I am thankful for this blog for many reasons. I feel like I have been going through a learning process in my own life lately, and I am blessed to be contacted by Uncommon Goods. I am thankful that I have been introduced to this website, and I am thankful for amazing causes such as this one. *Thanks to Uncommon Goods for sponsoring this post!

If you\u2019re a beauty product lover like me, you will want to check out this post to find out more about Birchbox. Since I joined right at the end of January, I\u2019m going to review my January \u0026 February boxes today!  Birchbox is a subscription box that allows you to test out amazing samples at the low price of $10 per month. Who doesn\u2019t love getting mail?! And who doesn\u2019t love getting beauty products in the mail? Beauty products are expensive, but Birchbox allows you to try samples without breaking the bank! I wanted to share my January box with you:  I loved the pattern on this box, but what I loved even more was that I got to pick out a word to define 2016. I chose \u201cambition.\u201d This is the year that I start my real life job as a pharmacist, and I could not be more excited. This is the year that all of my hard work and dedication to this profession will pay off! I can\u2019t wait to help others better their lives. Here are the products in my box for January:  1 \/\/ 2 \/\/ 3 \/\/ 4 \/\/ 5 \/\/ 6 1: This Jurlique rose balm I actually received for free for joining! My friend Ricci has a rose balm that she uses, so I\u2019m excited to try this one! 2: Key West Aloe gentle facial cleanser. I\u2019m excited about this product, because it contains 30% aloe. Aloe is a major key to pH balance on the face! 3: Cynthia Rowley eyeliner. This is a deep black eyeliner that I love and have used before. Perfect size to throw in my bag and take on the go. 4: Supergoop CC cream. As I get older, I\u2019m getting even more serious about protecting my skin. I\u2019m glad this protects against UVA\/B \u0026 infrared-A rays! 5: Beauty Protector detangler. I\u2019ve also used this detangler before and I\u2019m obsessed with it. It\u2019s not heavy and also protects against heat damage. AND it\u2019s safe on color-treated hair. 6: Vasanti enzymatic face rejuvenator. I\u2019ve never heard of this product, but it\u2019s highly rated among Birchbox customers. I will try this microdermabrasion product when I need to remove dead skin off of my face\u2026thanks winter. NEXT UP, my February box!  Here are the products I received for February:  1 \/\/ 2 \/\/ 3 \/\/ 4 \/\/ 5 1: Hey Honey peel off mask. SO excited about having a mask in my box. Peel away masks are my jam, because I don\u2019t have to wash them off ;) 2: ARROW Revive cooling cheek tint. I\u2019m excited to test out this product, because it\u2019s oil-free and claims to give a natural glow. I\u2019m all about that natural look for every day! 3: Klorane dry shampoo. OKAY you know I\u2019m obsessed with dry shampoo. I am already loving this new one I got to try. It smells fresh \u0026 clean! 4: POP beauty matte lipstick in \u201csatin rose.\u201d Already obsessed with this matte lipstick! GOAL: matte lipstick that looks matte, but does not dry your lips out. This lipstick totally takes the cake on this one, and I\u2019m wearing it right now! 5: Juara candlenut body cream. YUM this smells amazing. I feel like I\u2019m on a beach somewhere. It also is very moisturizing \u0026 a little bit goes a long way! I\u2019m beyond pleased with both my January and February boxes from Birchbox. I really recommend trying this service as you can cancel at any time! It also makes a great gift for your BFF! You can choose a 3, 6, or 12 month subscription.

I just got back from Dallas this last weekend \u0026 I wanted to recap the trip for you. My BFF, Ricci, and I decided we needed to get out of town. You know, one of those times when you just need to get away from it all? Yeah\u2026that. I had texted her probably like a month ago and said, \u201cI need this chair at IKEA!\u201d She quickly replied, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s plan a Dallas trip.\u201d If you live anywhere in Arkansas, you will quickly learn that there is ZERO good shopping here. The closest is definitely Dallas, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that it happens to be my favorite city in the whole world. (if you\u2019ve been reading here, you know that!)  *I severely failed in the picture taking area this trip\u2026just try to follow along ;)* We discussed where we would stay for a while based on what we wanted to do in Dallas. Since IKEA was the whole reason for this trip, we decided to stay at the Westin Stonebriar in Frisco. OKAY, best decision ever. I have stayed here a few times before, and it never disappoints! Our room was HUGE and super comfortable. It was also amazing to have a sliding door that we could open each morning \u0026 let the fresh air in! I highly recommend this hotel!!! When we first arrived around 9pm on Friday night, we of course hit up the Cheesecake Factory at Stonebriar Centre. We are total basic white girls and we are not ashamed of it at all! I got the cherry cheesecake which is completely different than my usual turtle. I liked it because it wasn\u2019t as rich as the turtle. The cherry made it pretty tart! After an amazing night\u2019s sleep, we got up the next morning \u0026 headed for the Dry Bar at Northpark. First of all, I love blowouts. If you\u2019ve never had a blowout at the Dry Bar, go ahead and put it at the top of your list right now.  When you go to the Dry Bar, you can choose from a menu of various hairstyles. I chose the \u201cCosmopolitan\u201d per the usual. I seriously always feel sorry for my stylist, because I have SO much hair and it\u2019s super tangly. She was a trooper though \u0026 I loved the result! I also picked up two products that I hadn\u2019t tried: \u201cSouthern Belle\u201d volumizing mousse \u0026 the NEW \u201cMr. Incredible\u201d leave-in conditioner. I haven\u2019t used the mousse yet, but I will tomorrow, because it will be raining! The leave-in conditioner totally helped me be able to brush out my tangles better\u2026just be sure to only spray on the ends and not on the roots! No one likes greasy hair ;) After that, we headed out into the mall to get our shop on. Let\u2019s all be honest\u2026that was the entire purpose of this trip in the first place. Because Dillard\u2019s has a monopoly on Arkansas, we have no access to Nordstrom except online. I\u2019m totally not complaining, but there\u2019s something about an actual store that gets my little shopping heart all excited.   We did some major damage at the MAC counter. We had the most fabulous makeup artist, Aubrey, who taught us some fab contouring tips. I\u2019m going to recap all of my beauty products I got later in the week, so stay tuned. After shopping, we might have possibly gone back to the hotel to take a nap\u2026OOPS. We are pretty much old at this point, so we needed our beauty sleep. Saturday night, we decided to head to Studio Movie Grill \u0026 see the new movie How To Be Single. Ricci had already seen it, but I think she felt it was her duty to go with me because I really wanted to see it! STOP EVERYTHING\u2026this was the best movie I have seen in a while. Rebel Wilson is hilarious and I loved that it had several different story lines. I\u2019m totally buying this when it comes out.  Super casual outfit details: Red tank, Torrid \/\/ Necklace, Kendra Scott \/\/ Wristlet, Henri Bendel \/\/ Leopard Flats, old (similar) *Insert rant here* I get a little bit tired of people thinking that because I am single must mean that I\u2019m unhappy. This could not be further from the truth. I have been in college for YEARS now, and I have no desire to be in a relationship at this point. But guess what? That doesn\u2019t mean I am lonely or sad at all. I have the BEST friends in the entire world. I also have more than enough work to keep me occupied as I am about to graduate pharmacy school. Moral of this story? I am HAPPY with my life just like it is :) *END RANT* After the movies we headed back to the hotel and got a good night\u2019s sleep. Sunday, we headed to IKEA! Finally, right? I had been wanting the Tobias chair, so I picked it up plus a couple of other items. When I finally get around to putting it together, I will show you on Instagram! We grabbed some Mi Cocina (my fave) on the way out of town. Now that I look at this post, I want to apologize for the lack of pictures! BUT HELLO, we were having way too much fun. Oh by the way, I\u2019ve succumb to the peer pressure \u0026 I\u2019m now on snapchat (rebekaheliz) SO ADD ME!

I\u2019m here to share this steal vs. splurge edition on some cute handbag finds. For me, I cannot justify spending thousands on multiple handbags. I also wanted to focus on neutral handbags that can be carried during different seasons and on many different occasions. **Disclaimer: I am not hating on those with designer handbags. I am not in a place where I can afford multiple designer bags, so I wanted to share some that look similar and are super affordable.**   First up, the timeless black handbag. This bag is super cute and I\u2019ve had my eye on it for a while. I cannot afford a huge $1390 price tag, so I found a similar bag for just under $25! I really like the gold accents on this bag as well. Next, this blush pink handbag is adorable and will transition well into spring. It looks like a \u201ccamera\u201d bag to me. I remember people several years ago carrying their cameras in bags like these. I really like the gold chain on this steal bag that I found for $20! Last up is this cute saddle bag. This luggage color is classic and would work well year-round. Definitely can\u2019t see myself paying $1395, but this similar look is only $23! The tassel is ADORABLE, too!      I hope you enjoyed seeing these great deals I found on similar bags. My favorite place to find affordable handbags is here! Maybe one day I will be able to afford a \u201csplurge\u201d like this, but for now these \u201csteals\u201d will do! Thanks for reading \u0026 let me know what steals you have found recently!

I hope you have had a great weekend. It\u2019s totally been snowy the past few days, so I thought I would share a total wanderlust post featuring 4 perfect road trip destinations for you \u0026 your BFF\u2019s. Also, let\u2019s just forget I used the term \u201croad trip,\u201d because driving is SO not the fastest way to get to some of these places.  The best part? They all have warm, sunshine-y weather on the horizon! Quick note: I would like to start a series of posts under the category of \u201cWanderlust.\u201d What\u2019s interesting is that I must\u2019ve missed the vocab lesson on the fact that there was a word for the desire to travel the world. So, here\u2019s to me learning what \u201cwanderlust\u201d means \u0026 a series of posts that are either on my #bucketlist or my checked off bucket list! {Marfa, Texas}  You can thank the lovely Courtney Kerr for putting this on my radar. She visits Marfa in her show, Courtney Loves Dallas, and takes pictures here with her BFF\u2019s. There is a free-standing Prada store in this tiny little town in Texas. A. PRADA. Of course, it\u2019s only a museum but who are we kidding? Talk about every girl\u2019s dream. My bloggy BFF Ricci \u0026 I want to go to Marfa ASAP. {Charleston, South Carolina}  To me, there is nothing I love more than a good dose of southern, laid back culture in a city filled with history. There are so many adorable houses I want to look at, as well as great shopping\/spas. And who really wants to take their boyfriend\/husband shopping with them? No one. So, send the boys off to golf while you and your BFF do some retail therapy! And get a facial (and massage) while you\u2019re at it. If anyone is from Charleston or has visited, let me know in the comments which spa is your favorite. {Malibu, California} I have never been to California! Until my recent Vegas trip, I had never really even been close. There\u2019s something about that Pacific Ocean that has my name all over it. I think it would be so much fun to get in a convertible and drive down the Pacific Coast Highway with no plans and nowhere to be. A little part of just freaked out about that last sentence with the \u201cno plans\u201d business, but maybe we all need to let down our hair every once in a while.  and the splurge\u2026 {Nevis, West Indies}  *all images are linked to original owner by clicking directly on the picture* Hi paradise, nice to meet you. Ok I know, this is a total dream location \u0026 you can\u2019t exactly get there by a \u201croad trip.\u201d It\u2019s one of those once-in-a-lifetime vacations that I can only dream about. But what fun is it to not dream? I only know of one person who has ever been here, but apparently the water really is THAT clear. And look at those blue skies? Talk about gorgeous. I\u2019m pretty sure even if I was only able to spend 24 hours in Nevis, it would totally be worth it. What do you think? If you want to check out more of my #bucketlist destinations, I have pinned some to my Pinterest that you can check out here! I have also started a #bucketlist here on my blog so check that out, too! Thanks for reading, Rebekah PS: if you would like to do a guest post featuring a wonderful place you\u2019ve traveled or want to travel, email me at rebekahelizblog@gmail.com \u0026 we can schedule it! I absolutely love getting to know my readers \u0026 what they like.

I can\u2019t believe the weekend is almost here. It\u2019s been a long week ;) Today I wanted to share another hair post, this time on my hair extensions that I received from Irresistible Me! They were so kind to send me a set of hair extensions for me to try out.  This post has been a LONG time coming, because I was having trouble figuring out exactly how to make these work. I\u2019m glad though, because now my hair is SUPER long and I was able to create a very natural look with these hair extensions. My extensions: Medium Brown \/\/ 16\u2033 \/\/ 140g Initial reaction: Oh my goodness, these are so dark! I was SUPER scared when I first opened the box, so I had to walk away and come back to them. Process: I will not pretend to know everything (or even anything) about hair. I have just recently in the past couple of years finally mastered the big, loose wavy curls. I know\u2026it\u2019s sad. When I opened the box, I knew I wanted to curl the extensions with my wand. I curled each piece and let them sit overnight. The curls were loose and wavy. When I was ready to put the extensions in, I curled all of my hair with my wand. Since I was just trying these out, I only added 4 extensions\u2026the single strands (2) and the double strands (2). There are several more strands I didn\u2019t use this particular time. I clipped in each strand toward the front of my face. I was sure to clip them in so you can\u2019t see them. Since my hair is SUPER dark at the roots with an almost ombre toward the bottom, this medium brown color actual looked amazing. They blended in SO well and ended up giving my hair amazing dimension and volume! Reveal:  Since it\u2019s winter, I think the dimension that the dark strands add is awesome! I totally wish I had taken these extensions to Vegas now! Final look: (I wanted to share a photo in a white shirt so you could see just how awesome the extensions look!)  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-  Products used: Dry Shampoo, Psssst! \/\/ Hairspray, CHI (Enviro 54 firm hold) \/\/ Root Booster, Redken \/\/ Curling Wand, Nume (32mm) ALSO, you will totally want this lip duo I have on, I\u2019m obsessed with it! Apply one coat of the lip plumper then wait around 1 minute and apply a thin layer of the balm.  Lip plumper, Dior \/\/ Lip Balm, Revlon (color is \u201celusive\u201d) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- If you have any questions, PLEASE email me.

It\u2019s almost the weekend \u0026 I can\u2019t wait! Today I wanted to share my everyday, go-to hairstyle I will be adding more of my favorite hairstyles as I go here on the blog. Keep in mind that I\u2019m not the most creative ;) I live in the South \u0026 all I have to say is one word: HUMIDITY. That being said, most of the time I do not straighten my hair. my hair: super tangly + very wavy {TIP} to solve the tangles: Moroccan oil (dime sized amount for thick, shoulder-length hair) + the wet brush  {TIP} to \u201cwash\u201d your hair without washing it: PSSSST! Dry Shampoo (I have tried over 10 different dry shampoos \u0026 this one is the best and it\u2019s CHEAP!) {TIP} if you are ever needing extra body at the roots: Redken 15 Quick Tease is a lifesaver! Just spray lightly on your roots and wait 1 minute then fluff.  {HOW-TO} natural, everyday curls: 1. the night before: wash your hair, apply a dime-sized amount of Moroccan oil, brush through, let your hair air dry (NOTE: do not apply too much oil or your hair will become oily\u2026a little goes a long way here!) 2. the morning: wake up \u0026 immediately spray your hair with gel\/spray (I like bumble + bumble primer\/re-styler) 3. go on getting ready scrunching your hair every few minutes 4. after getting ready (and AFTER you have your clothes on), flip your head over and spray with strong hairspray (I like CHI Enviro 54 Firm Hold) 5. flip your hair back over \u0026 part to your liking 6. scrunch \u0026 go    As always, comment below if you think of any ideas for me or have any questions.

I am on rotations for the next couple of months, and I usually have little to no time to get ready in the mornings. There is hardly time for me to brush my teeth, much less put on lots of makeup. (Don\u2019t worry, I take several minutes to make sure my teeth are super clean!) I have tried many products over the years but I have narrowed it down to just the basics that work well\u2026  (Makeup bag, Stella \u0026 Dot \/\/ Necklace, Stella \u0026 Dot)  Step 1: Primer, Tarte Apply a dime sized amount all over your entire face and be sure to cover evenly. Why I love it? This primer fills in your imperfections, allows your foundation to go on evenly, and helps your makeup last all day. Did I mention it feels like silk?! Step 2: Foundation, Clinique I use a beauty blender to apply this foundation over my whole face. Be sure to blend well in key areas, such as jaw line, eyebrows, and around your nose. I use the color \u201c28 Light.\u201d This color matches my skin PERFECTLY, so I don\u2019t have to worry about a mismatch. Step 3: Highlighter, Clinique These chubby sticks pretty much are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I apply highlighter in 5 key places: upper cheekbones, middle of lower lip, middle of chin, just below my eyebrows, and in the corner of my eyes closest to my nose. How to apply? I use my finger and dab in this highlighter and then apply to the places listed above. Be sure to blend. You will see an amazing change in how much your face glows after this step. Step 4: Contour, Clinique The highlighting stick\u2019s BFF: the contour. I apply this stick in two places: on the side of my nose and along my lower cheekbone. How to apply? For your nose, right at the bridge make a skinny line down each side. Blend with a contouring brush. For your cheekbone, make a \u201cfish face\u201d and apply a skinny line of this stick along your cheek bone toward your ear. Blend with a contouring brush. Step 5: Bronzer, NARS + Kabuki brush, NARS I use the color \u201cLaguna\u201d which is dark enough to show contrast, but not dark enough to look like I laid in a tanning bed for hours ;) Again, make a fish face, and apply on the apples of your cheeks with a blush brush. I guess you could say I use this bronzer as my blush. It will give you great color! Step 6: Eye Shadow, Bobbi Brown (similar here \u0026 here) + brush, EcoTools (LOW price!) This eye shadow palette is amaze! I use the non-shimmer taupe on the top middle row for an all over eye lid color. I will then add the dark brown on bottom left below the crease of my eye lid. Blend well and you are good to go. Step 7: Mascara, Benefit This mascara is my favorite for everyday use for one reason: WATERPROOF. I am not always looking for massive curl or extension for an everyday look, so I like that this mascara lasts all day and still makes my eyes pop. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re working in the humidity or you are sweating\u2026this mascara stays put! Step 8: Lips, YSL (\u201cnude provocateur\u201d) + MAC (\u201ccreme cup\u201d) I first apply the YSL gloss coat on my lips. About 5 seconds after you apply, you will see how it changes the feel of your lips. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s locking in the moisture. I then apply a layer of MAC \u201ccreme cup\u201d lipstick. This pink color is just enough color to keep it interesting, all while being muted enough for the workplace.  (photography: Melanie Kay) I really hope you enjoyed my five minute face routine. I promise after you practice this routine, you can probably do it in like 3 minutes.

I had to share my favorites with you\u2026  Kate Bosworth in Dolce \u0026 Gabbana I probably shouldn\u2019t love this pink sequin gown as much as I do. I am OBSESSED with this gown, because it involves my two favorite things: pink + sparkle. I really like how she has her hair slicked back as well! \u2014\u2014\u2014-  Lily James in Marchesa Lily James is starring in the new Cinderella film and this dress is totally giving me that Cinderella vibe. I LOVE the top, because it is something different and has a great keyhole. The bottom is so lovely and airy! \u2014\u2014\u2014-  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in Atelier Versace Only Rosie could pull this dress off so perfectly. Her hair looks effortless and this dress sparkles in the best way! Gold can be hard to wear, but she definitely nailed it. \u2014\u2014\u2014- AND MY FAVORITE OVERALL\u2026  Gina Rodriguez in Zac Posen I have ALWAYS loved Navy Blue. It looks so classic and chic. I really like this look, because the makeup and hair are understated and simple. Her makeup looks very natural and lets the dress do all the talking!

I\u2019m back today to share what I found to be the best shopping in Vegas. If you haven\u2019t already, be sure to check out my overall Vegas recap post! I really didn\u2019t have much of an idea what to expect about shopping in Vegas. Let\u2019s be honest, I had never been there before and Las Vegas in general is a pretty overwhelming concept. I did know that I wanted to buy a souvenir in Vegas, and I had the intention of it being a cardholder. (I don\u2019t carry large wallets usually, so a cardholder is the perfect answer!) What I learned: Most of the shopping at the hotels became repetitive. For example, the shops inside the Bellagio were pretty much the same shops that we found inside the Aria (The Shops at Crystals). These were luxury shops that I am definitely not used to seeing here in Arkansas. It\u2019s so fun to go into Louis Vuitton or Chanel and dream! We weren\u2019t shopping for anything in particular, so it was great to just walk into all of these stores I\u2019m not used to seeing. I loved the architecture\/design of the Shops at Crystals\u2026  Toward the north end of the strip is the Fashion Show Mall. This is where you can find many different stores including Nordstrom and Neiman\u2019s. You can also find GAP and Tory Burch here. If we had more time in Vegas, we definitely would have spent an entire day (or two) inside this mall! If you\u2019re headed to Vegas with shopping on your mind, this is definitely a great mall to check out. Again, we don\u2019t have Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus in Arkansas at all, so this was a treat! My advice: If you are headed to Vegas with the specific idea of shopping, sit down before you go and figure out where the stores are that you want to visit. Since we didn\u2019t have a plan, it was great for us to just walk around. Must-see shopping:  1. The Shops at Crystals inside the Aria hotel  2. Wynn Esplanade (more on the amazing decor here in a future post!) 3. Bellagio   Remember, Vegas is HUGE. It can easily be overwhelming. I really liked that we didn\u2019t have an \u201citinerary\u201d per se, because we were able to walk up and down the strip and take our time. I would definitely recommend this! If you have any questions, please reach out to me via email. Thanks for reading!

I\u2019m finally here with my first Vegas post. Today I wanted to recap the trip overall. We will dive more into detail in future posts. ENJOY! When I first started blogging, I admit I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I wanted a place to share my life and for it to be an outlet for stress that I was experiencing in pharmacy school. LITTLE did I know that I would meet some of my very best friends through blogging. This past week, I headed to Las Vegas for New Year\u2019s with two of my blogging besties: Ricci + Jenn. About 4 months ago, Ricci got the (genius) idea to go see Maroon 5 on New Year\u2019s Eve. Let me just say up front\u2026MOST EPIC IDEA EVER. If you know me, you know my love for Adam Levine (along with the rest of America)! Last Wednesday night, Ricci and I packed up and drove to Dallas to spend the night before catching our flight the next morning. Little did I know this was more sleep than I would get for the next 48 hours ;) We boarded our plane the next morning and headed for Vegas! Flying in was CRAZY. I had no idea that the airport would be SO close to the Strip. It was right in the middle of all the action. We headed to our hotel and Jenn met us there. We had asked our friends for restaurant\/tourist recommendations and so we decided on Gordon Ramsay BurGR for dinner.  It was delicious. After that, we headed to Mandalay Bay for the Maroon 5 concert. I don\u2019t know that you need much of a recap of the concert\u2026it was absolute perfection.  New Year\u2019s Eve look: Pink Blouse, Torrid (exact in red + gray \u0026 love this pink top)\/\/ Black Leggings, Target \/\/ Suede Booties, Sole Society \u0026 here \/\/ Necklace, Charming Charlie (under $20!) \/\/ Hairspray, Big Sexy Hair \/\/ Root Booster, Redken \/\/ Nail Polish, OPI \u201cAlpine Snow\u201d We watched the fireworks from our hotel room that night and they were gorgeous. Several hotels put on a fireworks show at midnight! The next morning, we slept in pretty late because we had been out so late the night before. HELLO, we had to catch up with Jenn because we hadn\u2019t seen her in like 2 years. (Next time, let\u2019s not wait so long okay?!) We decided to walk down the entire strip to see what all we could see. Let\u2019s be honest\u2026I was like a kid in a candy store at the shops inside the Bellagio. (We are talking Chanel + LV\u2026I might have even picked up a little souvenir ;)) OH, by the way, the fountains outside the Bellagio are a must-see for the water show that happens throughout the day!  I\u2019m sure several of you have heard of Serendipity in NYC, but there\u2019s also one here in Vegas. We decided to hit it up that afternoon for some of the famous frozen hot chocolate. We all got different kinds to try!  We explored the Strip a lot more and walked through several of the hotels to check out the decor and such. That night, we got tickets to see \u201cO\u201d by Cirque du Soleil at the Bellagio. It was an amazing show. The entire set is over water \u0026 they literally fly from so high and dive into the water\u2026MUST-SEE!  We ended up getting back to our hotel at around 1am and had to leave for the airport at 3am. It was a whirlwind trip but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It was SO great to catch up with my friends and head to Las Vegas, because I had never been there before. Be sure to check back for more details about my trip that include what you have to see and do!

SO sorry that I have been MIA for so long. Life got majorly busy. As this year draws to a close, I wanted to share something I\u2019ve been working on\u2026my list of rules to live by. Some of them aren\u2019t so much rules but more like a statement.  If you know me, you know I love to make lists. You would also know that I love to watch NCIS. If you watch this show, you know that Gibbs has a list of rules and I think it would be a great idea to have my own list. Here\u2019s what I have come up with so far: 1. Times change, people don\u2019t. I remember hearing this quote back in high school from one of my speech teachers and it didn\u2019t really resonate with me until lately. I truly believe it though. Stop and think about it, people in your life, did they really change? Or was it just the situation around them? 2. Sleep is overrated. You can sleep when you\u2019re dead. Talk about a lesson I learned a lot while in pharmacy school\u2026this. Sleep is definitely not something I am used to getting enough of. But at the end of the day, I want to be able to say that I don\u2019t have any regrets. I would much rather be busy than bored! 3. Never burn a bridge. If I could tell anyone younger than me one lesson, it would be this. You will NEVER know who you will come across in your life. And you never know when they will cross paths with you again. Be kind to everyone. It will serve you well, I promise. 4. Always trust your gut. I\u2019ve had to make some pretty big life decisions lately, and this is a piece of advice that I\u2019ve been trying to follow. No one knows you better than yourself\u2026if you have a gut feeling about something, it\u2019s for a reason. Always trust your gut instinct. Now I want to know, what would be on your list of \u201crules to live by\u201d? Let me know in the comments below.

I am fully prepared to spend the weekend catching up on blogging, social media, and FOOTBALL. Lots \u0026 lots of football. Today I wanted to share a topic that all of us girls can agree on: we like to be comfortable. What good is being comfortable if it\u2019s only part of the month? It\u2019s not. So, I have a great way to help stay comfortable all month long: U by Kotex curves liners. You no longer have to let liners stand in the way of your comfiness, because these liners are super thin + comfortable.  I have been planning my packing list for my New Year\u2019s Eve trip for almost a month now. If you didn\u2019t know, I\u2019m headed to Vegas for the Maroon 5 concert with my BFF\u2019s Ricci + Jenn. It is going to be epic! I got to thinking of a couple of things I wanted to be sure not to forget, and I\u2019m now including these U by Kotex curves liners. We are going to be flying and we ALL know how uncomfortable that can be. What I really like is that these liners are in super thin adorable packaging. I got a travel wallet I have had my eye on since last holiday season, and these U by Kotex curves liners fit perfectly inside. And you know that fear of dropping your bag and all your goodies falling out? These liners are so cute that no one will even know what they are.  Are you interested in trying these liners?

I have kind of a different post to share today. I didn\u2019t have any intention of even sharing this, but I was happy with the outcome so I will. The Holidays are fast approaching (my fave time of the year), so I wanted to share an easy, inexpensive gift idea with you. This DIY will take under 15 minutes \u0026 is SO cute!  Tomorrow is my last day of my 5th rotation. It has FLOWN by, and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already the end of October. I wanted to bring a small gift for the pharmacists I work with, so I thought this would be great for the season. Here\u2019s what you will need: 1 cute mug Box of individually wrapped hot cocoa Small package of individually wrapped chocolate Basket bag Ribbon 1-hole punch Mini card First, pick out a super cute mug. I found these plaid mugs at Target for under $3. I would pick something that goes with the season\u2026so with fall arriving, I chose plaid. Then grab a box of single serve hot chocolate packets. I chose the Starbucks hot cocoa packets. There were 8 packets in the box, so I gave each person two packets. I then grabbed a small package of chocolate for each mug. BE SURE that everything you get will fit down in the mug. I found these clear basket bags at the dollar store. There were two in each package. Now, this is where I will tell you a secret\u2026the bags look HUGE, and you will be tempted to cut them in half but don\u2019t. I have made this mistake more than once. Put each mug down into the bag and fill with goodies. Then pull up the ends and gather on top. Cut some curling ribbon in your favorite colors and tie around the bag where it cinches on the top like I have done in the picture. After you tie, you can now cut the excess plastic bag. Leave enough room that the bag is gathered at the top like this\u2026  After tying a couple of colors of ribbon, grab a mini card and fill it out and put in the envelope. Make a single hole punch in the top corner and thread through another piece of ribbon. Tie this ribbon with the card close to the center like in the above picture. The card is optional, but I really think it adds a cute touch! AND VOILA! You are done. How adorable is this gift? I would LOVE to receive this and your friends will, too! Cost breakdown (for each gift): Mug $3 Hot Cocoa $1.50 (the box of hot cocoa was $6 but came with 8 packets and I put two in each mug) Chocolate $1 Basket bag $.50 (the package had two bags for $1) Ribbon $.75 (I got 3 rolls at $1 each) Mini card $.50 (the package of 8 was $4 + I had some left over!) Total: $7.25 (Even with tax included, each gift would be below $10 easily) I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s DIY post. I will be the first person to tell you that this is pretty much the extent of my creativity. I\u2019m just super left brained and not creative at all ;) Thanks for reading!!

I hope your week is off to a great start. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already Wednesday. I have a super busy rest of the week and I will be traveling to see my niece for her birthday this weekend, so I\u2019m super excited! Pretty sure I\u2019ve been planning fall outfits for like 3 months now. But it\u2019s literally still 85 degrees outside, so a layout is all I\u2019ve got today. I wanted to share a new favorite necklace of mine: The Natalie by Stella + Dot! This necklace is fab for several reasons, but I especially love the color combination. You\u2019ve got both silver + gold metals so you can easily add other jewelry to it to complete your look. Also, I\u2019m a big fan of cobalt blue. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in blues for fall\/winter, but this cobalt is bright enough to not be blah. I wanted to play off the cobalt blue for this outfit inspiration: (as soon as it\u2019s cool enough to wear a vest outside and not be sweating, I will do an actual outfit post!)  MAJOR selling point is also that it\u2019s convertible. It can be worn without the cobalt strand. This would be great for a chic wedding (I\u2019m picturing like snowfall). So essentially, it\u2019s two AMAZING necklaces in one. The black part at the top is leather as well, so the quality is awesome. without the cobalt strand:  (via)  If I\u2019m going with major statement pieces like this necklace \u0026 glittery shoes, I\u2019m sure to go a little muted on the earrings. These Rebel Drop earrings are already in my jewelry box \u0026 they are my go-to! If you\u2019re looking for early holiday gifts, the Natalie necklace should definitely be on it. Your BFF would LOVE to get this under her tree (I know I would!). *Thanks to Stella \u0026 Dot for sponsoring today\u2019s post.

I hope you had a great weekend. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m already on my fifth rotation. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about where I want to end up and where I will be going after graduation. Sometimes I just like to google fun apartments in different cities. This immediately leads me to thinking about home decor and how I would like to decorate. I thought I would share my current mantle with you and why I chose to decorate it like I did! I have super high ceilings in my condo. To me, I want to maximize the height of the room, so I chose to go with a super tall frame on top of my mantle\u2026  Lucite Letter, old (similar) \/\/ Tory Burch In Color book \/\/ Bobbi Brown Pretty Powerful makeup manual \/\/ Lauren Conrad Beauty book \/\/ DVF Journey of a Dress book \/\/ Jeweled Frame, Kohls \/\/ Collage frame, old (similar)  This collage frame (which probably needs to be redone) includes pictures that I have collected that I like. It\u2019s almost like a big frame full of Instagram pictures. Be sure to include a couple of pictures of cool prints you like\u2026such as leopard or aztec. Also, be sure to include lots of your favorite color (for me, PINK). Target is a great place to find a good selection of affordable frames! And for wooden quote blocks, check Etsy! Items needed for a super girlie mantle: a monogram letter, a collage frame, several coffee table books about beauty + fashion, a jeweled\/mirrored picture frame, and a canvas with a cute saying.   So, if you are looking for a way to utilize the space above your mantle, choose a super tall frame because it will make the room look even taller! How do you decorate your mantle? Do you change it for the seasons? I would love to know!

I hope you all had a great Labor Day weekend. I got a lot done around the house and finally cleaned out my closet. I\u2019m back today to share a super easy and casual outfit with you which includes two of my favorite prints for fall: leopard + gingham.     photography: Melanie Kay Gingham button up, Nordstrom (similar here \u0026 here) \/\/ Taupe sweater, Old Navy \/\/ Jeans, Old Navy \/\/ Leopard Flats, Target (fall must-have!) \/\/ Earrings, old (similar) \/\/ Bag, Tory Burch (similar \u0026 clutch version!) \/\/ Watch, old (similar) \/\/ Nail Polish, Julep (\u201cKarissa\u201d) \/\/ Lipstick, Buxom (\u201cProvocateur\u201d) I admit that I have seen this exact combo (gingham + a cardigan) in several pictures that I have loved. I decided to take a small step outside of my comfort zone and pair it with another pattern: leopard. If you know me, you know I love leopard. These leopard flats are under $25 and a must-have for fall! I also don\u2019t ever wear red lipstick, but I thought this outfit definitely called for it. I also like a bold lip paired with a bold nail polish. These reds match perfectly. Now, I will go into my bag spiel with you. Yes, this is a Tory Burch bag. They are not cheap by any means, but I want to say this: they are GREAT quality. I have carried this bag to several pharmacy meetings and conferences and it looks just as new as the day I bought it. It will fit my laptop and a notebook easily and I use it for that. It\u2019s true: you get what you pay for.

For this review, I wanted it to be real. I committed to using the products for a month in replacement of my usual routine.   My skin before: sensitive with blackheads and oily combination. I was nervous at first, because my skin is super sensitive. After reading the list of ingredients, I knew that Exposed was something I should try. The new user guide led me through which products to use when which was really helpful. My skin after: bye, bye blackheads. My skin was healthy and hydrated. I also liked how the dead skin cells didn\u2019t pile up and I had 3 people comment on how much brighter my face looked. How I used Exposed: Each morning I would use the facial cleanser followed by the clearing tonic and the acne treatment serum. After this dried I would use the moisture complex then apply makeup as usual. Each evening, I would use the facial cleanser followed by the clearing tonic and the clear pore serum. ALSO, twice weekly I would use the microderm scrub which I will talk more about below. Favorite product overall: Microderm Scrub. I liked this product, because while it got deep into my pores to unclog them, it was not harsh or irritating. The tiny little scrubbers did wonders on my face and I have virtually eliminated all of my blackheads in just one month.  What I love about Exposed: no sulfates or parabens, no breakouts from the products, and beautiful packaging. (if you know me, you know I\u2019m a sucker for cute packaging ;)) Exposed gave me a list of five rules when keeping your skin looking great (AND THEY WORK): change your pillow case every 2 days, don\u2019t touch your face, drink plenty of water, sweat is good but wash it off, and avoid sugars when necessary. Something I never did was change my pillow cases often, but this definitely helps! Lastly I want to make a comment about this company in general. I was very pleased with the way I was contacted and the respect I received from them. I have the utmost respect for this company and their goals involving skincare. Thank you so much to Exposed for letting me try their product line. I have incorporated several of the products into my daily routine to keep my skin looking fresh and hydrated as we head into fall. Thanks for reading \u0026 let me know if you have any questions.

I hope you have some fun plans for the holiday. I plan on cleaning out and continuing my fall organization process that I\u2019ve had going on all week! Today I wanted to share an awesome product that I got to try: evian facial spray. I know what you\u2019re thinking: water for my face? What\u2019s the good in that? I will tell you.  If you live anywhere humid like I do (Arkansas), you know how impossible it is to keep your makeup looking fresh. Evian facial spray keeps your face cool + hydrated when facing this ridiculous humidity. I was a little nervous to spray it on right after putting my makeup on, but have no fear: IT WORKS. It will keep you looking fresh all day without drying out your skin. Other ways you can use Evian facial spray: throw it in your gym bag or keep a bottle in your car. Also, a little trick, this water will help tame those little baby hairs that you get around your face. Mine are always an issue (even my hair stylist says so), so just spray on a little of this water \u0026 you are good to go. Be sure to check out Evian on facebook or on their website! And while you\u2019re at it, be sure to enter this giveaway for a chance to win some Evian facial spray. XO, Rebekah *Powered by BrandBacker.

I\u0027ll go with the former. As much as I love Autumn\/Winter style; layering, dark colours and a whole lot of knitwear, it gets to this time of year where I start to miss putting together an outfit without having to consider which coat I\u0027ll be paring it with. Wearing lighter shades is also something I\u0027ve been missing a lot and although, lets face it, I\u0027d be more than happy wearing an all black outfit 99% of the year, I still like to dabble in the occasional pop or colour. White can be a particularly hard shade to pull off in the colder seasons. I had a love affair with wearing nothing but back in Summer, and my wardrobe is still littered with floaty white dresses that I\u0027d just love to be wearing right now. White in Winter though tends to work best when its reserved for knitwear and this funnel jumper from Topshop is one of my favourite throw on pieces at the moment. Its thick, warm and with it\u0027s \u0027not-quite-a-polo-neck\u0027 its a lot less bulky than some of the other roll neck knitwear in my collection. Paired together with some Farleigh jeans from Asos, my favourite for a high waist, cropped ankle and - sharp inhale of breath here, knee rips (I just don\u0027t really think light denim is complete without them) and my first flats of the year and you\u0027ve got yourself a Winter appropriate look with just a sniff of Spring in the air.

A Red Lip Normally I wouldn\u0027t pair a red lip with something white but in Winter it just seems to work. I could talk your ear off about all the reds in my collection, but this is the one that\u0027s been on my lips and coincidentally, in the bottom of my handbag repeatedly at the moment. I\u0027ve mentioned my love for Tom Ford Matte Lipsticks a whole lot in the past, and the shade Ruby Rush from the collection is the perfect red red. Its not blue toned, its not orange or pink. Its just red. I\u0027m sure a few of you are sitting there scripting your heads right now, but trust me, this is a lipstick to suit all. The formula is also one of the most pigmented I\u0027ve ever come across and just the right amount of matte to not be drying but still give a velvety smooth finish.

Rosa Viola No matter what shape or size Diptyque candles may come in, my love or them really knows no bounds. They\u0027ve become one of my favourite items to collect and pop around the house in any nook that needs something special. Therefore, whenever a new limited edition candle comes out I more than often jump at the chance to add it to my little collection, and when I saw the sickly sweet pink packaging of Diptyque\u0027s newest launch Rosa Viola - a special collaboration with Franco-British designer, Olympia Le-Tan adorned with red lips and everything, I spent a little longer than usual lingering around the candle section in Space NK. Clearly someone took note of this, as come Valentine\u0027s day I was presented with a bag full of goodies which, alongside an iced vanilla late and novelty kitten stickers - that boy knows me well, included a neatly wrapped parcel which I opened to find this inside! The first thing that hits you when opening any box housing a Diptyque candle is the scent. They\u0027re so highly fragranced that even without burning, if you\u0027re sitting next to one you\u0027re going to be smelling it.  Rosa Viola is quite different from most Diptyque offerings with notes of roses, lipstick and the subtle warmth of leather all designed to come together to smell like the inside of a woman\u0027s handbag. Note: this is definitely not what my poor bag smells like. To me it\u0027s sweet and feminine with a warm and inviting edge that prevents it from becoming too sickly. After walking into a room in which this had been burning for a few hours you\u0027ll be greeted with the cosy but fresh scent of roses which when combined with the more unusual additional notes makes for an intoxicating aroma.

Seriously, are we going to be able to get through 2016 without immediately assuming that\u0027s an Adele reference..? So you\u0027re probably noticing things are a little different around these parts! This is actually the fourth time I\u0027ve given I Covet Thee a revamp in it\u0027s soon to be five years of existence. We\u0027ve now got bigger images, more ways for you to interact with the site and, fingers crossed if my novice coding skills have all worked out, easier navigation!  You may have also have noticed that this is the first time I\u0027ve published a post in around three months. If there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve learnt from having this space for nearly half a decade is that it\u0027s okay to take a break from time to time, in fact at some points it\u0027s even necessary.  ICT 4.0 Last year definitely wasn\u0027t my favourite of the handful I\u0027ve been given and my motivation and creativity took a spiralling downfall because of that. Better to miss a few posts about new lipsticks than burn out altogether though I\u0027d say! It feels so good to be typing away again and the words are flowing freely! I guess now would be as good a time as any to make a little dedication to, you the readers of ICT, and do a little housekeeping while I\u0027m at it too. I\u0027ve realised I\u0027m never going to be the blogger that posts on a daily basis. I have no idea how some of you out there do it, I\u0027m literally in awe! Instead I think a schedule of a few times a week are what\u0027s going to suit this place the best, and in those posts I want to make it really worth your while to have clicked on them! After a few months of playing around with video scheduling I\u0027ve also decided to have a little shake up. Sunday mornings and Friday evenings will now be the time and place for uploads and you may even occasionally see a sneaky vlog or two popping up on a Wednesday evening. Believe it or not I haven\u0027t actually picked up my vlogging camera since December and it\u0027s something I\u0027m itching to do again soon! My last port of call here is actually to open the floor to you! What do you want to see from ICT in 2016? What have been your favourite posts to date and also which topics take your fancy the most? Your input means so much to me, so have a good think, and I\u0027ll see you again next week!

Of course I will still go back to said brands and most likely make friends with them once again but for now all of these products are being booted out of my makeup collection!\u00a0   Revlon Colorstay Shadowlinks in Plum and Sand\u00a0\u00a32.99 - Boots here Me and Revlon go way back. I remember they were someone of the first lipsticks I tried as an adult and I still to this day I swear by their lip products. So whilst shopping online I decided I needed to tried out their eyeshadows as I\u0027d never gotten around to. I went for the Shadowlinks as the idea of linking your eyeshadows together to create your own palette is pretty ingenious. But sadly what was inside just didn\u0027t live up to my expectations. I found both eyeshadows to be extremely chalky in texture and dry which just isn\u0027t flattering on the lids and makes blending a bit of a nightmare. I also found the pigmentation to be lacking compared to cheaper eyeshadows from MUA and Makeup Revolution. These had so much potential but sadly the quality just isn\u0027t there!  Rimmel 24hr Super Curler Mascara\u00a0\u00a34.99 - ASOS here\u00a0 When a mascara goes and calls itself Super Curler you expect it to curl. Am I right, or am I right? So when I whipped this out of my Powder Beauty Drawer I expected fanned out lashes that would last all day. Instead the result for much like any other standard mascara. It gave a bit of volume but the curl that was there was from using eyelash curlers. Within hours my eyelashes had drooped back down to their normal sorry state and I was thinking how glad I was that I didn\u0027t actually spend any money on it. This may have been able to curl better if the brush hadn\u0027t of been so damn huge but due to the size I just couldn\u0027t get in there to the base of my lashes and wiggle n\u0027 push away. As an average mascara it\u0027s ok and it does actually stay on the lashes without smudging or flaking at least.\u00a0   B. Pure Micellar Cleansing Oil\u00a0\u00a0\u00a36.99 - Superdrug here Over the past year or so I\u0027ve tried quite a number of B. from Superdrug skincare products and loved them all! For me they\u0027re an understated brand that deserves more attention and coverage online. So when placing a random little Superdrug of products I didn\u0027t need I decided to pop this interesting looking Micellar Cleansing Oil into my basket. My saving grace was that it was half price so a total bargain but I simply didn\u0027t think it removed makeup that well. You see you are supposed to first wet your face, then sweep over your makeup with a splash of the oil on a cotton pad and then remove the excess with a clean cotton pad. Now wetting the skin did makes sense but after rubbing the oil soaked pad around your face the oil had pretty much soaked into the skin so when I went back in with a dry cotton pad it removed very little makeup. I could use this as a normal cleanser with warm water and a flannel but it also feels very thin for a cleansing oil but not in a smooth silky way and it really is over fragranced for no real reason. Sadly this will be passed onto someone that doesn\u0027t mind a cleanser that doesn\u0027t fully remove makeup.  Models Own Copper Chrome Nail Polish\u00a0\u00a34.99 - Superdrug here \u00a0For the longest time I\u0027ve been such a cheerleader of Models Own products and would say they are in my top 3 nail polish brands as the formulas are great and I love how creative they get with each collection. So when the Chrome collection with the amazing mirrored packaging was launched I was pretty darn excited. I heart emoji\u0027d over that Copper shade like you wouldn\u0027t believe and so when I got my paws on it I had high hopes for it. Now I should have really shown you what Copper Chrome looks like on the nails because a picture is worth a thousand words and you would instantly have seen why it was such a let down. But you can see swatches of the full collection courtesy of Nail Lacquer UK here. The other shades in the collection really are stunning especially the chrome blue, however Copper Chrome reminds me of that old fashioned pearl shade my nan was ever so fond of - just not flattering or anything like the gorgeous bottle, basically a total let down. As for the formula is wasn\u0027t as thick as I\u0027d have liked and due to having a metallic finish shows up imperfections and ridges in the nails. I kind of feel like Models Own wanted to get on the copper trend but couldn\u0027t execute the shade well enough.\u00a0 I\u0027d love to know if you\u0027ve ever experienced any rubbish products from brands you love!\u00a0Fee xo.\u00a0  ","date":"1458208800","title":"Disappointing Products From Brands I Love!","media":"https:\/\/farm2.staticflickr.com\/1681\/25793779736_8df89fd675_o.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"https:\/\/farm2.staticflickr.com\/1681\/25793779736_8df89fd675_o.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMi5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGMTY4MSUyRjI1NzkzNzc5NzM2XzhkZjg5ZmQ2NzVfby5qcGc=?checksum=51f8d47c3d29784bd76426543ae0efbf8d920276\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Makeup Savvy","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4797148905\u0026blog=3888670\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/3888670\/4797148905","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/makeup-savvy-3888670\/disappointing-products-from-brands-i-love-4797148905","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/makeup-savvy-3888670\/disappointing-products-from-brands-i-love-4797148905","likes":4},"4794181384:3888670":{"post_id":"4794181384","blog_id":"3888670","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/co\/XRuB\/~3\/SBt_zeyV8I8\/ebay-bargains-40-newest-pro-makeup.html","content":"\u00a0 \u00a0Recently I\u0027ve come across more and more amazing makeup brushes on eBay that are high in quality and affordable! The above brushes are the latest I\u0027ve found that all look amazing and start from only \u00a31.69 including delivery!\u00a0 Large Professional Powder Brush\u00a0\u00a32.27 - eBay here\u00a0\u00a0Ahhh, this looks a thing of beauty! From the long silver handle to the ultra soft looking bristles, this looks like it will be an amazing brush for translucent powder, blush and any other powder you want to use it with! I love finding brushes like this. It goes without saying I\u0027ve already purchased this brush and it will feature it in an upcoming eBay haul when it arrives.  Flat Top Kabuki Brush\u00a0\u00a32.56 - eBay here\u00a0Now this is a dupe\/replicate of the Tarte Flat Topped Kabuki which I wouldn\u0027t generally recommend a fake of (especially when it looks like it may come with the Tarte branding on) however as it\u0027s not pretending to be from Tarte in the title I\u0027m hoping it won\u0027t as generally fake products focus on looking exact like the original and scrimp on the quality. That being said I\u0027ve seen a few reviews on this style of brush and they have all been positive. This would be fab for buffing in foundation for a flawless finish.  Etude House Pro Oval Foundation Brush + 2nd attachment\u00a0\u00a38.23 - eBay hereI don\u0027t even know how I came across this brush but I remember thinking WOW! This is definitely new to eBay and a take on the popular and expensive Artis oval brush. It isn\u0027t as cheap as all the rest however it is a 2-in-1 brush and from Etude House so you can be sure that the quality will be great.\u00a0  Bronze Foundation Brush\u00a0\u00a31.69 - eBay hereThere\u0027s something about this brush I love, I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s the matte bronze handle that looks so chic but it could be that it looks quite a unique shape with the slant for a foundation brush. Again it\u0027s another brush that you can tell has ultra soft bristles and will hopefully be really good quality! Also it\u0027s the cheapest of my finds!\u00a0  Extra Large Pro Oval Face Brush\u00a0\u00a32.99 - eBay here\u00a0\u00a0Lately oval brushes have become very popular due to both MAC and Artis and you can find many a standard size oval brush on eBay (you can see a review of the one I picked up in my Top 5 eBay Brushes post here). And now finally we are seeing the large oval dupes hitting eBay! This just looks amazing and such a unique brush to try out and a totally steal of a price!  Double Ended Foundation\/Contour Bamboo Brush\u00a0\u00a33.49 - eBay here\u00a0\u00a0Lastly I have a lovely double ended brush to share with you that reminds me of something you would pick up from Tarte or Kiko. The shorter end looks like it would work well for foundation and the opposite end looks like it would be ideal to contour with. Another brush that is new to eBay!\u00a0 Hope you\u0027ve found some interesting yet cheap brushes to try out here!\u00a0 Fee xo.

They look pretty as decoration in blog photography, they are nice to review and smell lovely. Of course I\u0027m sure there are beauty bloggers out there that have zero interest in candles but I\u0027m certainly not one of them, with a stash of wax to rival the shelves of my local Hallmark shop.\u00a0 Above is a snippet of my collection that I\u0027m currently burning and enjoying. So I thought I\u0027d share with you a few of my current favourite scents and the candle brands I will always go back to. \u00a0 Village Candle\u00a0 Believe it or not, Yankee Candle isn\u0027t my favourite candle brand! Instead my go-to home fragrance brand is Village Candle, a candle brand easily mistaken as a knock-off of YC but in fact quite a bit more true to scent and with so many fragrance options to pick from. My all time favourite candle from Village Candle is Brownie Delight which as you can see is running on the low side (FYI - I plan to scrape out the unburnt wax at the side and use in a wax tart burner once it\u0027s completely finished with). Within minutes of lighting this candle my open plan living room\/dining room\/kitchen is filled with the richest chocolate brownie scent that is so true to the real scent that it often makes me hungry but also warm and comforted. This truly is my favourite scent to burn and one I will always re-purchase and burn any time of year!\u00a0 Along side medium to large jars, Village Candle also offer votive candles that are an inexpensive way to try out more scents from the brand. I generally pick these up from eBay for around \u00a32.50 including delivery and have tried quite a few amazing scents now. I\u0027m currently trying out Warm Buttered Bread, Lemon Pound Cake, Maple Butter and Cherry Vanilla Swirl - all of which I love! My favourite scent from trying out the votive candles is Warm Buttered Bread as it\u0027s just such a unique scent that leans more on the savoury side which makes a nice change and again it\u0027s such a true to life scent that fills the room for hours. I also love Lemon Pound Cake as it\u0027s fresh but moreish and just as if I\u0027ve been baking. If you love Yankee Candle already or you\u0027re after a new candle brand to try out then this is certainly the one!\u00a0  Where to buy - I personally find it easiest to purchase from eBay but select Hallmark stores do stock them. Brownie Delight Medium Double Wick Jar (\u00a312.99 - eBay here), selection of votive candles (from \u00a32.78 - eBay here).   Wax Lyrical\u00a0 Wax Lyrical is a home fragrance brand that\u0027s been going strong for years and can easily be found it quite a few supermarkets. The Wax Lyrical shelf in my local Tesco generally distracts me from food shopping as their candle tins are inexpensive at \u00a36.00 (frequently reduced\/on offer) and the scents are always in line with the season, my favourite time of year for Wax Lyrical being Christmas as they come out with some amazing scents - think Figgy Pudding, Mulled Wine and Christmas Cookies!\u00a0 My new favourite is a lovely spring floral scent in Sweet Pea, this is part of the RHS Garden range and is just perfect for this time of year. As the candle tim is on the small size, though it has a burn time of 25 hours, I like to burn it in a smaller room to achieve the best scent throw but I\u0027ve found the scent is most noticeable once I\u0027ve blown the candle out, which is different from all the other candles I\u0027ve burnt in the past. As for the \u0027sweet pea\u0027 scent it\u0027s well, sweet, and floral and very spring appropriate and clean. I also love Wax Lyrical for reed diffusers, again mostly at Christmas time as they excel themselves but sometimes as a treat to myself throughout the year.\u00a0  Where to buy - Tesco and Waitrose seem to be the best stockists of Wax Lyrical. You can also always find a bargain or two on Tesco Direct of past ranges\/stock here.   TK Maxx\/Homesense\u00a0 Another place I like to shop for candles is TK Maxx as they generally have an extension\u00a0 and affordable range. It also encourages me to try out different brands and get something that bit different when it comes to the candle packaging. The above mirrored Sugar Cookie Candle was something I picked up last Christmas for under \u00a35 and initially purchased due to how it looked but it\u0027s in fact a lovely candle to burn and not just at Christmas. You can sometimes find discounted Yankee Candles in TK Maxx but I find it\u0027s best just to be led by your nose and pick out something that grabs you or just looks pretty - certainly the place to go if you are wanting an aesthetically pleasing candle or lantern for your desk.\u00a0 Where to buy - This is self explanatory but I would say that if you have a Homesense store near you then visit it! They stock an extensive range of candles and the rest of the store is just amazing - I\u0027m yet to leave empty handed!   Candles to try soon - the new range of large jar candles from Home Bargains that look very similar to Bath \u0026 Body Works candles, the Jo Malone Pomegranate Noir dupe found in Aldi for \u00a32.99 and more votives from Village Candle.  I\u0027d love to know your own favourite candle brands!\u00a0 Fee xo.\u00a0    ","date":"1457949600","title":"Candles Galore - My Current Candle Collection","media":"https:\/\/farm2.staticflickr.com\/1555\/25286201509_bd0a5ef803_o.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"https:\/\/farm2.staticflickr.com\/1555\/25286201509_bd0a5ef803_o.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMi5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGMTU1NSUyRjI1Mjg2MjAxNTA5X2JkMGE1ZWY4MDNfby5qcGc=?checksum=ac5dd479b896bebf4400f4992fe99a606dbf1835\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Makeup Savvy","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4792711640\u0026blog=3888670\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/3888670\/4792711640","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/makeup-savvy-3888670\/candles-galore-my-current-candle-collection-4792711640","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/makeup-savvy-3888670\/candles-galore-my-current-candle-collection-4792711640","likes":14},"4790345271:3888670":{"post_id":"4790345271","blog_id":"3888670","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/co\/XRuB\/~3\/9ctKYsV--Lc\/ebay-bargains-39-99p-finds.html","content":"After such a good response to my last 99p eBay Jewellery Finds I thought I\u0027d share with you a selection of my favourite 99p finds on eBay!

It\u0027s almost as if it is expected that once you reach your twenties and so on, that your skin should be clear from blemishes - not the case for myself and many, many others. Hormonal acne can appear at any time from puberty to menopause and wouldn\u0027t it be nice if you could not only treat the problem but also protect your skin? Luckily a few brands, one such being Clinique have began launching adult specific skin-saving solutions, that target blemishes and signs of ageing. If you suffer from such skin woes and use serum, you may want to add Clinique Anti Blemish Solutions Blemish + Line Correcting Serum to your wishlist.   Clinique Anti Blemish Solutions Blemish + Line Correcting Serum has been specifically created to target acne without drying out the skin (it is also oil free to prevent irritation), as well as smoothing out the skin texture - a grown-up solution to acne if you will. In my opinion it is exceedingly light weight and almost (and I do say almost) has a gel-like texture that is instantly cooling and hydrating. It doesn\u0027t tingle nor sting the skin (sometimes an issue with blemish targeted products), and in my experience it does not leave the face looking nor feeling greasy - as it is to be applied both morning and night, I do feel this is important. I should also add that when worn under make-up it will not alter the finish, nor wear time.  Rather impressively Clinique Anti Blemish Solutions Blemish + Line Correcting Serum contains a fairly stellar line up of ingredients: to gently exfolaite the skin and encourage cell renewal for brighter and clearer skin there is Salicylic Acid. To boost collagen and elastin levels for plumper and altogether smoother skin the Blemish + Line Correcting Serum contains both peptides and Whey Protein. To calm, soothe and reduce redness the gentle serum has been infused with evening primrose; to brighten and generally rejuvenate the skin caffeine is also present. Lastly Clinique have ensured that this serum doesn\u0027t just provide an instant hit of moisture, rather it will encourage the skin to cling onto and retain moisture, long after it has been applied - a clever and quick way to keep the skin comforted and of course hydrated.   At the moment I am fairly line free (I\u0027m in my 20\u0027s) but as they say a prevention is better than a cure, and I would rather apply a product specifically designed for my skin type rather than risk irritation. As someone with an oily complexion I rather enjoy that\u00a0Clinique Anti Blemish Solutions Blemish + Line Correcting Serum\u00a0gently hydrates my skin without feeling heavy, and to an extent does help to speed up the skin recovery process - aka blemishes heal quicker.

FORMULA OVERVIEW | ColourPop Ultra Satin Liquid Lipstick ($6.00 for 0.11 fl. oz.) is supposed to be a \u201clightweight, bold lipstick with a satin finish\u201d that is \u201cextra intense colour saturation\u201d and \u201clong-wearing,\u201d but the brand is quick to note that it is \u201cnot completely kiss proof.\u201d The consistency is very light to lightweight with a thin to mousse-like consistency\u2013they feel a little heavier going on than the Ultra Matte formula, but they don\u2019t feel heavy on. They dry down somewhat, but it isn\u2019t a full, flat dry down like matte liquid lipsticks, and when you press your lips together, there is moderate tackiness there, but I didn\u2019t notice any lifting or separating of color by doing so. Thus far, they have been extremely long-wearing and comfortable to wear for the most part\u2013it\u2019s after ten hours or so that I notice my lips feeling a little dry\u2013but six hours into wear and the colors have looked good post-meals\/post-drinking. I think if you like the idea of longer-wearing, mostly matte lip color but find most liquid lipsticks too drying or too flat while not needing an ultra-hydrating formula, you might like these.

Ze zijn niet alleen lekker, maar ook heel gezond voor je. Ook is het perfect beautyfood, want het bevat onder andere de volgende ingredi\u00ebnten: Vitamine C Net zoals vitamine B, helpt ook vitamine C om gezond, glanzend haar te behouden. Ook je huid en nagels worden sterker door vitamine C. Het stofje vitamine C komt daarom ook veel voor in huidverzorgingsproducten. Kalium Aardbeien bevatten veel kalium. Kalium zorgt onder andere voor het vochtbalans in je lichaam. Je blijft er dus goed door gehydrateerd en dat heeft weer een mooi effect op je huid. Salicylzuur Aardbeien bevatten een grote hoeveelheid Salicylzuur. Dit stofje helpt tegen acne! Zo doe ik eens in de twee maanden een peeling met salicylzuur bij een kliniek, maar dit kan je dus ook \u2018licht\u2019 zelf doen met een aardbei. Als je last hebt van acne, kun je af en toe een natuurlijk aardbeienmaskertje maken en op je gezicht smeren. Sommige mensen gebruiken een aardbei ook om hun tanden natuurlijk te bleken, door het zuur wat erin zit, maar pas hiermee op! Het kan erg schadelijk zijn voor je tanden. Aardbeien kun je op ongelooflijk veel manieren gebruiken en verwerken in je beautyroutine. Je kunt je mond scrubben met een aardbei, je kunt heerlijke gerechten en smoothies maken met aardbeien, gezichtsmaskertjes met aardbei maken etc. Maar een aardbei is natuurlijk ook een lekker stukje fruit tussendoor! Eet jij wel eens aardbeien?","date":"1458223212","title":"Beautyfood \u2764 Aardbeien","media":"http:\/\/i993.photobucket.com\/albums\/af56\/beautygloss\/2016\/2016%20-%20Februari\/strawberries_zps9pnorkmv.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/i993.photobucket.com\/albums\/af56\/beautygloss\/2016\/2016%20-%20Februari\/strawberries_zps9pnorkmv.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmk5OTMucGhvdG9idWNrZXQuY29tJTJGYWxidW1zJTJGYWY1NiUyRmJlYXV0eWdsb3NzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjIwMTYlMjUyMC0lMjUyMEZlYnJ1YXJpJTJGc3RyYXdiZXJyaWVzX3pwczlwbm9ya212LmpwZw==?checksum=b2618255dab7f2dabedd64dcb32da6a7bd5bd065\u0026format=h"}},"name":"beautygloss.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4797422394\u0026blog=233795\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/233795\/4797422394","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beautyglossnl-233795\/beautyfood-aardbeien-4797422394","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beautyglossnl-233795\/beautyfood-aardbeien-4797422394","likes":3},"4795937009:233795":{"post_id":"4795937009","blog_id":"233795","link":"http:\/\/www.beautygloss.nl\/2016\/03\/16\/mac-flamingo-park-%E2%9D%A4-voorjaarscollectie-blushes\/","content":"Spellbinder \u2013 What I Fancy Twee blushes uit de MAC Flamingo Park voorjaarscollectie en de mac faerie whispers collectie.

I always wish I was one of those loyal fragrance-wearers who has a \u2018signature scent\u2019, the kind that instantly reminds those closest to you of you\u2026 but in reality I\u2019m just too fickle with scent and my taste is constantly changing and developing. Over the years I\u2019ve found myself gravitating to more and more \u2018grown-up\u2019 scents. I still can\u2019t handle full-on floral but I\u2019ve definitely developed more of a nose for florals and muskier, more unusual scents.Even though I\u2019m writing this on one of the rainiest days in British history (I\u2019m currently sitting on a 3-hour delayed train due to flooding on the tracks) Spring is definitely on it\u2019s way. These three are all perfect for spring as they are light, fresh and feminine... The first is Maison Martin Margiela\u2019s \u2018Beach Walk\u2019 from their Replica collection. I adore the concept of this range, designed to remind you of specific moments in history, this particular scent being of sun kissed salty skin in Calvi, 1972. I also love the bottles, reminiscent of apothecary bottles with white twine detailing around the neck and no lids. They do, however come with an *eye watering* price tag of \u00a385 for 100ml Eau de Toilette, so for some that\u2019s an automatic turn off, but if you\u2019re into your fragrances they are worth taking a detour for in store to experience them. There are 10 scents in total, some female, some male and some unisex, but Beach Walk is by far my favourite with subtle notes of bergamot, pink pepper, lemon, musk, cedarwood and ylang ylang. Available online here.\u00a0The second scent I\u2019m loving at the moment is easily one of the most unusual in my collection. It\u2019s part of Jo Malone\u2019s new Herb Garden collection for Spring 2016 and it\u2019s called Wild Strawberry and Parsley. Whenever I think of strawberry notes in a fragrance I assume it\u2019s going to be sickly sweet and probably a younger celebrity fragrance. But the parsley in this fragrance adds a green freshness to the scent that smells unlike any other fragrance I\u2019ve come across. The entire collection is actually very unusual. Again, I would recommend checking it out if you\u2019re into your fragrances and happen to be passing a Jo Malone counter. I personally wasn\u2019t crazy about the other three scents in the collection but love this one when I want something a little different. It\u2019s only available in the handbag-friendly 30ml bottle and is \u00a344.\u00a0Available online here.\u00a0Lastly is the latest addition to Chloe\u2019s fragrance collection: Love Story Eau de Toilette. When \u2018Love Story\u2019 launched last year, I really wanted to love it (I mean, look at the bottle, it\u2019s simply beautiful!) But something about it was too much for me, too strongly floral and a little heady. I felt the same way about it as I do about the original Marc Jacobs Daisy\u2026 I like it in theory, but when I actually wear it, it just gives me a bit of a headache. Last month they launch the EDT version of the original and I\u2019m happy to report I\u2019m a fan! I\u2019m taking baby steps into the floral world but this is a nice in-between for those of you who want to love a floral fragrance like this, but can\u2019t quite handle the full-on effect of an EDP. It\u2019s still got strongly floral notes of Neroli, Orange Blossom and Jasmine, but a little softer and cleaner. It\u2019s \u00a342 for 30ml.\u00a0Available online here.\u00a0 What are your current favourite scents?\u00a0","date":"1457533860","title":"Spring Scents","media":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-VwYt21jv_0M\/VuAxWrha5II\/AAAAAAAANZ0\/bSeMIEq2V4U\/s640\/spring-fragrance-chloe-love-story-jo-malone-replica-beach-walk.JPG","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-VwYt21jv_0M\/VuAxWrha5II\/AAAAAAAANZ0\/bSeMIEq2V4U\/s640\/spring-fragrance-chloe-love-story-jo-malone-replica-beach-walk.JPG","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkYyLmJwLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbSUyRi1Wd1l0MjFqdl8wTSUyRlZ1QXhXcmhhNUlJJTJGQUFBQUFBQUFOWjAlMkZiU2VNSUVxMlY0VSUyRnM2NDAlMkZzcHJpbmctZnJhZ3JhbmNlLWNobG9lLWxvdmUtc3Rvcnktam8tbWFsb25lLXJlcGxpY2EtYmVhY2gtd2Fsay5KUEc=?checksum=d998045981989dd8caed181002fe25ccb833e8c4\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Fleur De Force","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4786253463\u0026blog=1756919\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1756919\/4786253463","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/fleur-de-force-1756919\/spring-scents-4786253463","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/fleur-de-force-1756919\/spring-scents-4786253463","likes":37},"4769821380:1756919":{"post_id":"4769821380","blog_id":"1756919","link":"http:\/\/www.fleurdeforce.com\/2016\/02\/lancome-juicy-shakers-review.html","content":"It\u0027s very rare that something arrives on my doorstep and within half an hour I\u0027m already writing up a review, but Lancome\u0027s latest beauty drop is so cool I simply couldn\u0027t wait to share it with you all! You might have seen or heard a few things about the new \u0027Beauty Shakers\u0027 online already as they are without a doubt the most exciting beauty launch of the year so far. They combine the fun vibe of the original Lancome Juicy Tubes, with a more modern texture and even more innovative packaging and application...  They are essentially a tinted lip oil and are very similar in texture to the YSL tint-in-oils that launched last year (albeit with a little less stain!) It\u0027s the packaging and application is what makes them really special. You have to shake the cute cocktail-shaker-shaped tube before use to combine the pigment and oil, then use the wide cushion sponge applicator to apply them to your lips. There are three small holes that sit just under the sponge to ensure that exactly the right amount of product is deposited on to the tip. The sponge itself feels like nothing else I\u0027ve ever tried before... the only way I can describe it is that it\u0027s like applying your lipgloss with a soft gummy sweet!  Each of the 14 shades available in the UK (there are 20 globally) has a different scent (mostly fruity, but there are a few cakes and caramels in the mix too.) The oil texture is really smooth and glides onto the lips. The pigmentation is quite sheer, but build-able to a medium level of pigmentation for the deeper shades. Lancome were kind enough to send me eight of the shades to try and I\u0027ve swatched them all below so you can see the difference in pigmentation between the individual shades. Some are matte colours, some have a shimmer running though them, but they all give the same fresh glossy finish and all are totally non-sticky. 8 of the 14 shades L-R: Berry Tale, Freedom of Peach, Apri-Cute, Berry in Love, Walk The Lime, Wondermelon, Lemon Explosion \u0026 Cherry SymphonyThese are the perfect daytime handbag lip products for those who want the benefits of a lip oil (they are formulated with sweet almond, peach kernel, cranberry and musk rose oils) with the shine and colour of a gloss. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d want all the shades as they are so sheer and therefore some of the shades aren\u0027t hugely different on the lips, but if you\u0027re a beauty addict, they are a must-try product! Juicy Shaker in Cherry SymphonyTheir only downside is the staying power. As they are completely non-sticky, similarly to most lip oils, the staying power is not the best. They are definitely a product you\u0027d want to reapply during the day, but seeing as they are such a pleasure to apply, this definitely doesn\u0027t bother me! They launch into Selfridges and Lancome.co.uk next week on the 2nd March, then nationwide at Lancome counters from 16th March and are \u00a318 each. You can already get them on the Selfridges website\u00a0here. What do you think guys, will you be checking these out? Also... who was a fan of the original Juicy Tubes as a teenager?! I was obsessed!

The Extraordinary Clay collection is aimed to combat that problem, absorbing excess oil from the roots while leaving the ends silky smooth, therefore eliminating the need to wash your hair as often. The collection consists of four products: A pre-shampoo masque, shampoo, conditioner and a dry shampoo. All contain three different clays - a totally new ingredient to the L\u0027Oreal line-up! White clay to purify the roots, blue clay to hydrate the ends and green clay to revitalise the entire fibre. So do they actually work? I\u0027m happy to say that I\u0027ve got on really well with this range, it\u0027s even allowed me to get an extra day in between washes (brilliant news if you\u0027ve got coloured hair like me and you don\u0027t like over-washing it!) Firstly for the packaging. It\u0027s the same as the rest of the Elvive range, but in a lovely bright blue\/turquoise shade. I know you shouldn\u0027t judge a book by it\u0027s cover (or a shampoo by it\u0027s bottle in this case!) but I have to say the colour looks great in my bathroom! The first step is the clay masque, which you apply for five minutes onto dry hair before washing it off. This is quite heavily scented, which I worried about a little the first time I used it as my scalp can be sensitive to heavily fragranced products sometimes, but this didn\u0027t irritate it at all. I thought it might be a bit messy, but the texture of the mask is thick and (strangely enough) clay like! So it stays in place nicely. After using the full routine together my hair feels clean and soft, not stripped as it often does with volumising or oil-minimising\u00a0products.   The real test however, is in how long this feeling lasts and I\u0027m happy to report I can easily leave my hair three days without having to re-wash it after using this. On the final day I might need a little re-fresh with the dry shampoo but that works really well too as it has very minimal residue and doesn\u0027t leave that chalky texture at the roots either. The whole range launches is in store now but you can get it now on Boots.com where they currently have the three wet products on offer together for \u00a310 (link here).

The new multi-use balms come in a dome shape similar to the cult EOS lip balm, with a convenient flat-top, twistable lid. There are four different shades, all with different scents and they are designed to be used both on the lips as a sheer colour balm and on the cheeks as a wash of dewy colour...  The formula is lovely and feels beautifully smooth on the lips and not sticky whatsoever, however as a blush I\u0027m slightly sceptical as it feels a little too greasy for using on the cheeks without the fear of it melting off your face entirely or just leaving a general sticky feeling on the skin. I think the one exception to this would be in the summer time as a 5-second makeup update post-beach or pool. Except for those rare occasions I would only really use these as lip balms. That being said, they make for really nice lip balms, which I personally prefer to the original baby lips (something about them seems a little creamier, and the packaging is nicer). The colour pay off is very sheer, but does add a subtle hint of colour to the lips. All of the shades are very nice and wearable (as they are so sheer, you definitely don\u0027t need them all though!) My personal favourite is the bright pink \u0027 L-R: Booming Ruby, Shimmering Bronze,\u00a0\u00a0Innocent Peach, Flirty PinkIf you\u0027re a fan of the original baby lips collection, these are a must-have!

I was lucky enough to be invited to the BAFTA\u2019s with Lanc\u00f4me earlier this month. It was an experience of a lifetime and not just because my dress broke ten minutes before we were supposed to leave the hotel! The term \u2018glam squad\u2019 is truly a real thing. It took 5 people to take me from 0-100 real quick, if you know what I mean. My makeup made me feel like an old Hollywood actress and I have no idea how Fortunado (the makeup artist) did it, but that lipstick managed to stay on all night!       We made our way to the red carpet where I got to stand beside Matt Damon of all people! I could have touched Kate Winslet, but I decided to act normal and save my fangirling for another occasion (hopefully). I had an amazing seat as I got to watch the awards show take place and the atmosphere was incredible. I didn\u2019t think it would feel any different from watching it on TV, but there was so much energy and enthusiasm in the room. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience for me. Wow!

This is my favourite time of year to mix things up. Earlier this year I was introduced to Shiseido and quickly became obsessed with both their products and the story behind the brand. The technology they use in their skincare is incredible and a few products from the Ibuki range have made their way in to my daily routine.       Although there are so many products in the range that get my thumbs up, the Quick Fix Mist is my top pick from the range. As well as using as a toner, to hydrate the skin and preparing it for further product, it can be used to refresh makeup on the go and really brings dull skin back to life (my absolute saviour if I\u0027ve tested a new foundation that doesn\u0027t leave my skin looking too fresh)! And then there\u0027s the Multi Solution Gel, a pot of magic that comes to the rescue of anything from blemishes to dry skin.

Myself and a few of my favourite girls were very kindly invited by the L\u0027Oreal Paris team to see a few of the shows and get a look backstage, as well as having our hair transformed by Christopher Robin and his team! I\u0027m going to talk about this in a little more detail in a separate post, but they used the L\u0027Oreal Paris Preference Infinia colours to create this look - it\u0027s so natural and I\u0027m so happy with it!\u00a0 It was a complete whirlwind trip, but luckily I had time to shoot this look before we left on Wednesday. This was my outfit for the Giambattista Valli show on Monday. I\u0027ve been after a Self Portrait Piece for so long and after my last trip to Paris where I saw Sandra wearing an incredible jumpsuit, I knew I had to have one in a similar style. I went for a more tailored trouser leg, as opposed to the culotte style they often release. I knew I would have to have the leg length severely altered and this shape not only made the most sense in that respect, but it\u0027s also super flattering on my shape. I\u0027ve learnt it\u0027s so much better to embrace the curves that trying to dress around them. I paired the one piece with my favourite black heels from ASOS, which after being caught in the torrential downpour we were caught in, are now looking a little worse for wear. Oops.\u00a0 I took my Chanel Boy to Paris with me with the original intention of pairing it with most outfits, but actually opted for my Givenchy Antigona with this outfit. I liked the way it broke up the monochrome look and also added a little sports luxe vibe to something that looked feminine and tailored.\u00a0 SHOP THIS LOOK  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content.  THE SHOWS And then we have the shows. On day one we arrived and headed straight out to the Giambattista Valli show, where L\u0027Oreal Paris were taking care of the hair. To contrast the frills and sheer, floaty fabrics, the hair was slicked back and given relaxed, glamorous waves. The makeup was minimal, yes flawless and the attention was focused around the brows, with a light amount of product through but given an extreme glitter highlight on the under side. #highlightonfleek On Tuesday we visited the backstage area of the Vanessa Seward show, where L\u0027Oreal Paris were doing the makeup. Honestly I spent most of my time photographing Taylor Hill and now have more photos of her and Gigi Hadid on my memory card than I care to admit... #stalker The makeup look was minimal, with a little definition at the lashes and some models sporting a black cut crease - making the eyes stand out underneath the beautiful sequin veils they would later be walking in. Unfortunately I was facing against the light on a beautifully sunny day, so photos from this show are a no go, but the whole look was really beautiful.\u00a0   Et Voila! So that is my Paris Fashion Week run down! It was such an amazing experience and has only inspired me to want to attend every single season. So a huge thank you to L\u0027Oreal Paris for the wonderful opportunity.\u00a0","date":"1457869440","title":"Bonjour!","media":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-wvG5KeA0F04\/VuSddAHDBUI\/AAAAAAAALVM\/gofFklKqtNQlX8ReQzpUdr3yNZTg72dtw\/s1600\/pfw15.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-wvG5KeA0F04\/VuSddAHDBUI\/AAAAAAAALVM\/gofFklKqtNQlX8ReQzpUdr3yNZTg72dtw\/s1600\/pfw15.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkYyLmJwLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbSUyRi13dkc1S2VBMEYwNCUyRlZ1U2RkQUhEQlVJJTJGQUFBQUFBQUFMVk0lMkZnb2ZGa2xLcXROUWxYOFJlUXpwVWRyM3lOWlRnNzJkdHclMkZzMTYwMCUyRnBmdzE1LmpwZw==?checksum=83c1c179ea1c14b0a51f8e78a394166d1087137d\u0026format=h"}},"name":"HelloOctober","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4791527843\u0026blog=4167479\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/4167479\/4791527843","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/hellooctober-4167479\/bonjour-4791527843","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/hellooctober-4167479\/bonjour-4791527843","likes":21},"4772016307:4167479":{"post_id":"4772016307","blog_id":"4167479","link":"http:\/\/www.hello-october.com\/2016\/02\/a-night-at-mondrian-london.html","content":"THE MONDRIAN, LONDON. This time last week I was preparing for a busy day of shows and shoots as part of London Fashion Week Day Three. Anya Hindmarch, Topshop Unique and Temperley invites were packed and ready to go, but the first item on the agenda was to check in to the Mondrian Hotel.\u00a0 Having already stayed once this month for an overnight press trip with Clarins, The Mondrian feels like it\u0027s become a second home for me this month. They even kept the previous stay details on file and allocated me the same room, so it really did feel like a home away from home. After a long day of shows, a night of good room service overlooking the river, with a balcony sweet lit by tea light candles (part of the turn down service - so cute!) was exactly what I needed. The suit I had is so spacious and bright that come morning time I almost bounced out of bed - almost - the beds are way too comfy to willingly leap out from.\u00a0 If you\u0027re looking for a luxury stay in London, I couldn\u0027t recommend the Mondrian enough There are so many hotels I love but I think this would have to be my number one recommendation!\u00a0 THE OUTFIT I thought I\u0027d also show you my super laid back outfit for London Fashion Week Day Four whilst we\u0027re here too - I had two shows on my list but unfortunately due to feeling so ill I couldn\u0027t make it - I\u0027d had the most hectic week running up to Fashion Week with deadlines and shoots - I had around four hours sleep each night and by the following week it obviously caught up with me. I was so gutted, as I couldn\u0027t wait to see Pringle with L\u0027Oreal Paris as they were doing the makeup and Joseph with L\u0027Oreal Pro to see the hair styling - both shows looked so incredible though as I watched them on the live stream!

Day Two really had been so much fun, and I woke on Sunday with a Champagne headache and a lot of work ahead. Two shows, a shoot and one paid project to work on. Quite the contrast to the previous 24 hours - surely it couldn\u0027t be as good? But yet again I was surprised as it still ended up being so chilled, everything ran according to plan for the most part, and I had another very enjoyable day of shows.\u00a0 THE OUTFIT Seeing as Topshop had invited me to the show this season, I thought it appropriate to wear a few pieces from the brand - but let\u0027s face it, it\u0027s not a shock to see me head to toe in Topshop is it?! I opted for a slouchy white polka dot shirt, partially tucked in to my Topshop tailored trousers, with a black scarf around my neck to add a little extra interest to the outfit. I picked out a long tailored grey coat to throw on between shows and finished everything off with black pointed heels and my beloved Chanel bag.\u00a0  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content.   THE SHOW(S) The day started off with Anya Hindmarch in the morning. The makeup was minimal with pops of colour on the eyes to match the clothing and the hair, by L\u0027Oreal Pro, was parted in the middle and left loose in a relaxed bedhead style. The concept of the show was pixel themed and was just very cute, with lots of pieces I would actually like to own amongst the collection.\u00a0 Topshop Unique followed shortly after, held in the Tate Britain, I took my seat early enough to sit and take everything in. It was my first time seeing Unique in the flesh, and I felt so honoured to have been invited to my favourite high street brands show. The collection felt far less seventies than previous seasons (thumbs up from me because that trend and I just don\u0027t gel) and the 80\u0027s hair, again by L\u0027Oreal Professional, was so beautifully done. I\u0027m really hoping we see a revival of the extreme side part again soon because that has to be my favourite hair trend of all time - should I even be admitting this? I digress... The colour palette ranged from warm autumnal colours to monochrome pieces and prints - everything I love in a nutshell. There was an embellished black skirt I just have to own, so watch this space! I genuinely think this has been my favourite season since they went Sports Luxe heavy in 2014 and I felt so lucky to have seen it in the flesh!\u00a0 Finally I made my way to Temperley, which you can read more about here as I was working back stage with Maybelline to bring you a full list of products used (as well as a video on Saturday - keep your eyes peeled)! Temperley ran over by quite a while, so I made my way back to my hotel room to crash, eat burgers and chat with my hotel next door neighbour Lydia, before writing up my show notes and catching some well earned Zzzz\u0027s!\u00a0 OUTFIT PHOTOS BY JOE GALIVN  ","date":"1456431420","title":"LFW Day Three 2016.","media":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-YVGD_ngEW3Q\/Vs9URy1yRvI\/AAAAAAAALTI\/2EHmRx5qLeI\/s1600\/LFW2-5.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-YVGD_ngEW3Q\/Vs9URy1yRvI\/AAAAAAAALTI\/2EHmRx5qLeI\/s1600\/LFW2-5.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkYyLmJwLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbSUyRi1ZVkdEX25nRVczUSUyRlZzOVVSeTF5UnZJJTJGQUFBQUFBQUFMVEklMkYyRUhtUng1cUxlSSUyRnMxNjAwJTJGTEZXMi01LmpwZw==?checksum=691de31652b7adcaefd166223826b62fd7ec434e\u0026format=h"}},"name":"HelloOctober","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4768615755\u0026blog=4167479\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/4167479\/4768615755","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/hellooctober-4167479\/lfw-day-three-2016-4768615755","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/hellooctober-4167479\/lfw-day-three-2016-4768615755","likes":20},"4797474666:3933164":{"post_id":"4797474666","blog_id":"3933164","link":"http:\/\/www.innenaussen.com\/2016\/03\/garnier-mizellen-reinigungs-wasser-waterproof.html","content":"Garnier beherrscht mit der Auswahl an Mizellenwasser den Drogeriemarkt (hat das W\u00e4sserchen aber nicht erfunden, sondern nur popul\u00e4r gemacht).

Of beter gezegd, alcohol denat, de vorm van alcohol die in veel cosmetica wordt gebruikt (zoals parfum, cr\u00e8mes en toners) en die behoorlijk irriterend en uitdrogend kan werken. Het is dan ook niet zo gek dat veel mensen liever deze stof vermijden, maar waarom wordt het dan nog steeds in zoveel producten gebruikt? En wanneer kun je het wel gebruiken? Ik ga het je vertellen! Welke soorten alcohol moet je vermijden? Alcohol denat is een gedenaturaliseerde vorm van alcohol die niet geschikt is voor consumptie. Dit wordt bewust gedaan, omdat iemand anders zo gek zou kunnen zijn om de producten te eten of drinken. Liever niet natuurlijk!

Hydration + repair should be the mane focus when you\u2019ve got down-time! Just landed on the magical island of Kauaii a few days ago and swiped some bottles of beachy goodness from the TBD beauty closet on the way out (Thanks Kristin!). Playing around with 5 bottles, using each one solo but also using some cocktailed together! See below for the breakdown. (And for those of you wondering, I air dried using number 1 + 5 together in the photo above!)  Photo by: Josh Tyvan Post by: Carachele Tyvan    1 .  Nourishing Hair Oil \u2013 Mostly coating my hair with this before I jump in the ocean. I find that coating your hair with an oil before taking a dip really helps. The hair soaks up the first thing it touches the most, so best to coat your hair in something before hopping into salt water.  2. Tropical Hair Treatment \u2013 This treatment is one of my favs! (Let\u2019s be honest, the coconut scent fully reeled me in.) It repairs, strengthens, moisturizes and replenishes your hair, while protecting it from damage that may be caused by the sun, ocean water or chlorine! You can layer it throughout your day as needed but you can also wear it as an overnight treatment, which is pretty cool.  3. Mythic Oil \u2013 This is more of a creamy oil. It\u2019s great for anyone who needs weight to their hair. My hair tends to air dry pretty \u201cwide\u201d so I use it to keep the silhouette of my hair a bit more narrow. (Update: I linked to another product which is very similar because the Mythic Oil is very hard to find\u2013 sorry!)  4. Finishing Spray \u2013 Dry oil sprays are interesting. They\u2019re fairly weightless but extremely shiny. Sometimes when I swim in salt water and come out, I like the way it air dries but sometimes it\u2019s a little too matte from the salt. If I want to give it a little shine but keep the texture from the salt water, I use a light veil of this to get the best of both worlds.  5. No Frizz Leave-in Conditioner \u2013 Loving this one for blowouts here in Hawaii. I\u2019m actually here for a wedding so this has been great for anyone who wants a blowout with no frizz because this leave-in also blocks humidity. But since the point of this post is to drop those hair-stressin\u2019 hot tools, forget I mentioned it. Ha! I\u2019ve been into mixing this one with the Oribe Nourishing Hair Oil. Amazing combo!

Except for instead of spraying it (which sets it), I do this technique. It\u2019s something I discovered on set with clients because as much as they may love me, they don\u2019t really appreciate me walking up to them and spraying their faces! So I needed to find a way to revive their powdered foundation another way. Here\u2019s how you can too:  \u00a0 TOOLS: Your Favorite Face Spray \u2014 By now you know I\u2019m beyond obsessed with Caudalie\u2019s Beauty Elixir (I buy the full size one ($$$) but you can try it out in this size ($)) because it takes years off of my clients\u2019 faces by creating the perfect amount of dewiness and glow without looking shiny or oily. I also really really love this dewy mist ($$) that instantly brings foundation and powder back to life, no matter how caked they have gotten. A Beautyblender Sponge \u2014 I especially love this one that comes with this fancy ring stand ($$) because it should always be on the counter so it can breathe and not in a makeup drawer with no circulation (I learned the hard way once when I cleaned it and put it back in my kit, only to find it mildewed!). STEPS: Spritz a few times into the palm of your cupped hand. Dab the back of your egg sponge into the solution until all of it has been absorbed. Now gently tap the back of the sponge over any areas that have gotten cakey. Continue over areas that need life again. You can do this any time your face needs it! \u00a0","date":"1457956811","title":"FOUNDATION \u0026 POWDER RENEWAL","media":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/tbd-midday-faceOPENER.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/tbd-midday-faceOPENER.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRjk3Ljc0LjY1LjE2MiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzLWMlMkYyMDE2JTJGMDMlMkZ0YmQtbWlkZGF5LWZhY2VPUEVORVIuanBn?checksum=852a2df9a0e2fb62a32a41c03e9610f8d0c3986a\u0026format=h"}},"name":"the beauty department","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4792794835\u0026blog=2521588\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2521588\/4792794835","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/foundation-powder-renewal-4792794835","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/foundation-powder-renewal-4792794835","likes":194},"4789722088:2521588":{"post_id":"4789722088","blog_id":"2521588","link":"http:\/\/thebeautydepartment.com\/2016\/03\/the-tool-box\/","content":"\u00a0  Photo by : Denman, Ibiza, WET Brush, Warrentricomi, Spornette, Mason Pearson, Moroccan, Martino By Martino Cartier, Proraso Post by : Carachele Tyvan  We\u2019ve refreshed our brush kit and have included a few newest and latest must haves! 1. THE DENMAN PADDLE BRUSH\u2013 You can detangle with it, blow dry with it, massage your head with it, and tease hair with it. It doesn\u2019t pull or scratch because of its perfectly rounded nylon pin-bristles, it doesn\u2019t cause static, and is padded with an air cushion. On a daily basis, I use it to blow my hair out quickly before I curl it with a curling iron. 2 . MOROCCAN OIL BRUSHES\u2013 This brush acts as a curling iron when it heats up. Most people use this when they want a little bend on their ends without using a curling iron. It has a hollow core which allows air to flow through. In other words, your hair is being dried from the inside as well as the outside, and that speeds up drying time. This brush is not my particular favorite because they often scratch the scalp and if you don\u2019t move fast enough, there can be too much heat between your blow dryer and the metal of the brush. 3. MARTINO BY MARTIONO CARTIER ROUND BRUSH WITH TOURMALINE \u2013 Need an quick efficient blow-dry? This Brush allows for a speedy blow-dry and is built to lock in moisture and cut frizz. 4. IBIZA ROUND BRUSHES\u2013 These are my favorite round brushes for home use. They\u2019re gentle enough to give into a tangle, but strong enough to get tension for smoothing out waves. This brush is packed with the perfect amount of bristles, making it much easier to manage the hair while styling. The benefits of this brush create a smooth and shiny look that can last you a couple day! 5. DENMAN THERMO CERAMIC -This is like #2 and #4 mixed together. Since this brush has both boar bristles and nylon bristles you have more control over the hair than you do with a regular metal core brush. The boar hair bristles also help prevent excessive contact between the hair and the metal. This is a rather versatile round brush. It can be used to create smooth straight hair or hair with lots of body. 6. SPORNETTE \u2013 \u201cPORCUPINE\u201d G36 -This is my all time favorite brush for bangs. Its an important, very affordable staple piece that\u2019s good to always have on you if you are in need of controlling untamable bangs. 7. THE MASON PEARSON \u2013 This brush is considered the \u201cultimate grooming\u201d brush. It is extremely gentle and nourishing on the hair and scalp. Although it is a bit pricy, it has its benefits! 8. PRORASO SHAVE BRUSH \u2013 All though The Proraso Shave Brush is generally used for a clean shave, I like to use it to tuck away remaining fly-a-ways on up-do\u2019s. The Trick here is to mist the brush with a strong hold hair spray and gently brush down any excess hair. 9. WET BRUSH  \u2013 The \u201d Life Saver\u201d of all brushes . I love to prep all hair types with this brush! It truly can detangle any type of hair wet or dry. What makes this brush so great is its ability to work through all tangles because of its intelliflex bristles. 10. WET BRUSH TRAVEL SIZE \u2013 The \u201cMini Life Saver\u201d because I love to use the Wet Brush so much Its a must to have one on the go. I use it to freshen up my hair or detangle any unwanted knots that happen through out the day. Its the perfect travel size companion and can help tremendously detangling and prepping all hair types! 11. IBIZA OC BRUSH SERIES\u2013 Brushes for everyone! Fine, Medium, Course, this brush is an amazing tool that helps prevent the brush from tugging, pulling or breaking the hair. 12. HAIR BRUSH CLEANER \u2013 This handy tool is a must have! It helps remove all excess hair and will preserve your tools!","date":"1457731914","title":"THE TOOL BOX","media":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/THETOOLBOX_BRUSHSCHOOL1-512x1354.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/THETOOLBOX_BRUSHSCHOOL1-512x1354.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRjk3Ljc0LjY1LjE2MiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzLWMlMkYyMDE2JTJGMDMlMkZUSEVUT09MQk9YX0JSVVNIU0NIT09MMS01MTJ4MTM1NC5qcGc=?checksum=904219cd92c16eca3a5dfa5d04ab6c7c348a6027\u0026format=h"}},"name":"the beauty department","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4789722088\u0026blog=2521588\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2521588\/4789722088","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/tool-box-4789722088","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/tool-box-4789722088","likes":280},"4787642605:2521588":{"post_id":"4787642605","blog_id":"2521588","link":"http:\/\/thebeautydepartment.com\/2016\/03\/lift-and-light\/","content":"TUTORIAL + PHOTOGRAPHY BY AMY NADINE, GRAPHIC DESIGN BY EUNICE CHUN  I love this trick because it accomplishes three beautiful things. First, the highlight above the brow creates the illusion that the brow is slightly raised. Second, the highlight below the brow creates the illusion that the lid is slightly raised. So both areas look \u201clifted\u201d. And third, both actions draw attention to the brows, lighting them up with a halo effect. Genius! It\u2019s subtle, as it should be, but worth taking a few seconds to do. Here\u2019s how: TOOLS: Your Favorite Concealer \u2014 In this case, choose a concealer that is a half shade lighter than your foundation. As always, I had my model Charlene use this iconic concealer ($$$) because it doesn\u2019t move after you apply it. I also love this one ($$) and this one ($). A Concealer Brush \u2014 this favorite of mine is on sale for $11 from $29! Or Your Favorite Highlighting Pen \u2014 I also love highlighting pens to highlight the brows. Try this iconic one ($$$), this illuminating one ($$) or this one($).  STEPS: After applying foundation all over your face, start just above the brow and sweep the brush from the distance of the beginning of the brow to the arch of the brow. Continue from above the arch of the brow to the end of the tail. Blend with your finger or a Beauty Blender. Do the same thing just underneath the brow, starting at the beginning of the brow to the end of the tail. Again, blend it in by tapping with your finger or a sponge. For inquiring minds, Charlene is wearing BareMinerals Moxie Lipstick in Go the Distance and this Marc Jacobs #7 Style Eye-Con Eyeshadow Palette.","date":"1457614824","title":"LIFT AND LIGHT","media":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/TBD-browlighterOPENER.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2016\/03\/TBD-browlighterOPENER.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRjk3Ljc0LjY1LjE2MiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzLWMlMkYyMDE2JTJGMDMlMkZUQkQtYnJvd2xpZ2h0ZXJPUEVORVIuanBn?checksum=95a302cbdaf05ef8c1a49e38d6df5e736b28c010\u0026format=h"}},"name":"the beauty department","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4787642605\u0026blog=2521588\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2521588\/4787642605","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/lift-light-4787642605","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/lift-light-4787642605","likes":131},"4796483941:1779819":{"post_id":"4796483941","blog_id":"1779819","link":"http:\/\/www.amodelrecommends.com\/2016\/03\/16\/marc-jacobs-new-nudes-sheer-gel-lipstick-review\/","content":"Well these are a sight for sore eyes, aren\u2019t they? I can\u2019t get enough of the packaging for the Marc Jacobs New Nudes sheer gel lipsticks. It\u2019s unbelievably cool; chic, but at the same time a bit chunky and retro. The casing is the kind of nude shade that would look equally at home moulded into a sixties plastic picnic set as it would on the catwalk, and I love the raised metallic logo and the round button at the base.  The lid and base are magnetised, which is quite pleasing \u2013 it feels reassuringly expensive when they click into place \u2013 but the packaging is all still relatively lightweight and (can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to use this word) fun.  I have two shades, Anais and Moody Margot. Anais, pictured above on the left, and on my face below, is the kind of warmish nude that looks polished and ladylike and it\u2019s brilliant for those who want a nude shade but don\u2019t like to look as though their lips are disappearing.  For those who do like to look as though their lips are disappearing (you know what I mean by that, don\u2019t you? When the colour sort of matches your skin? Not disappearing through thinness or \u2013 er \u2013 magic) there\u2019s Moody Margot, below.  It\u2019s pretty pale, but somehow still quite easy to wear. Perhaps because it has a bit of a sheen and juiciness to the finish. It\u2019s not like wearing a concealer shade, so you don\u2019t need to ramp it up with a crazy smokey eye and false lashes and all of that jazz, but it\u2019s light enough to give a beautiful neutral-toned look to the face. The \u201cgel\u201d texture is interesting; a sleek sheen that\u2019s almost glossy but has no tackiness and a comfortable, hydrating feel. It\u2019s not as light and fresh as I was expecting (for some reason I had it in my head that there would be a cooling effect!) but my lips are on the dry side, so it\u2019s actually a relief that it feels more nourishing. You can find the whole Marc Jacobs makeup range at Harrods and Sephora \u2013 the gel lipsticks are \u00a324 here.

A travesty! It\u2019s such a good little base \u2013 it behaves exactly how I want a foundation to behave, with a light and comfortable texture and a fresh, glowy finish. I recently pulled it back out of my stored makeup collection so that it can live in the house (rather than the cosmetics quagmire of my office) where it will be loved and well-used and perhaps even have the opportunity to travel the world. It\u2019s a fine old life for the chosen foundations, I tell you! (Currently the chosen ones in the en suite cabinet are: Armani Maestro Glow, Chanel Vitalumiere Aqua, Chanel Les Beiges, Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet (I\u2019m working on a comparison post), Max Factor Miracle Match and Laura Mercier\u2019s Silk Creme Foundation, which I think I prefer to the new Candleglow, but the jury\u2019s still out.) Anyway, I wanted to compare the new Bourjois City Radiance foundation to the older favourite, Healthy Mix Serum Gel Foundation. City Radiance is in a tube, calls itself a \u201cskin protecting foundation\u201d with \u201cbrightening effect\u201d and has an SPF30. Healthy Mix says \u201cinstant blending gel, flawless complexion, undetectable coverage\u201d on the back of the pump-action bottle and \u201c16h radiance-boosting\u201d on the front \u2013 the two foundations are after pretty much the same thing. Glowing skin. Though it does seem that the City Radiance leans more towards the idea of protection \u2013 protecting the skin from the ravages of city life perhaps? With the sun protection and the \u201canti-pollution screen\u201d that I\u2019ve just spotted on the front of the tube, that sounds about right. In all honestly, protection against environmental factors is something I look for in my skincare, if anything, so I can\u2019t say I\u2019m really going to dwell on that at all. I just want to compare them as cosmetics \u2013 coverage, finish, feel.  Things didn\u2019t get off to a great start for little new-tube City Radiance, because though I have my perfect colour match in the Healthy Mix (52, Vanille) I really couldn\u2019t find my ideal partner in City Radiance. I swatched 1, 2 and 3 and decided that 2 was the best match, but you can see in the (absolutely gorgeous, not) photo above that at first glance the match didn\u2019t look too great. (Bottom stripe is 1, top is 2.) However, shade 2 did blend out really well \u2013 behold:  I only have it on the right-hand side of my face, in the picture \u2013 you can see that not only is the shade more than okay, there\u2019s a real glow going on. The City Radiance is definitely brightening and I\u2019d say that the coverage is very good, though I didn\u2019t find it the most pleasant foundation to apply. It was ever so slightly too thick for my liking. But let\u2019s come back to that and skip on over to the juicy, fresh-feel Healthy Mix Serum and its lightweight gel formula \u2013 I\u2019ve applied this to the left-hand side, as you look at the photograph:  Now is it me, or does the Healthy Mix just look a bit more real? Less flat? I\u2019ve stared at my face for so many hours, now, that I\u2019m struggling to uncross my eyes, so I would love to know what you think. I\u2019ve done some close-ups of my skin, too. (God, you must really want to know about these foundations if you\u2019ve read this far! It\u2019s like a GCSE science project!) First, the City Radiance:  and then the Healthy Mix Serum:  (Sorry \u2013 that\u2019s a pillow crease you can faintly see down the side of my face. Ha.) You might not be able to see any difference at all, but zooming in on the computer I can tell you that the Healthy Mix does look just a bit more natural whereas the City Radiance is slightly flat \u2013 the skin has less of its natural variation and character left, probably because the coverage is slightly heavier. City Radiance reminds me a bit of a CC Cream, though I realise that CC Creams come in many textures and variations; it has a slight something that I want to call chalky, or claggy, but is neither. It\u2019s a creamy texture that settles to almost exactly the same finish as the Healthy Mix, I just don\u2019t think it has the same beautiful high-end feel. For me, the older classic beats the new launch. City Radiance has a different lean, as I noted before \u2013 highly portable in its little tube and with the added \u201canti-pollution screen\u201d and SPF 30, though I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d ever apply enough of it to provide adequate protection, if you were relying solely on that. It\u2019s still a good base, and if you want mega-glow and a more uniform look to the skin then certainly opt for this one (or the amazing Effaclar BB Blur for oilier skin). But if you think you\u2019ll be bothered by a thicker feel (I\u2019ve just thought \u2013 it\u2019s very much like the feel of a suncream, which makes sense!) and you\u2019re pining for that dewy, juicy, moisturised look that we all so loved before all of the more velvety finish foundations came along, plump for Healthy Mix Serum. Bourjois City Radiance is \u00a39.99 at Boots.com here and the Healthy Mix Serum is \u00a310.99 here.

I picked this out in a bit of a hurry, because Mr AMR was waiting for me in the car with the baby, but not before I\u2019d quickly had a scribble with most of the eye pencils and lipsticks in the range and given the mascara a cursory once-over. The cream blush \u2013 and the shade \u201cCamisole Blush\u201d in particular \u2013 would be my key product, if I was pushed to single one out; the highlighting stick also looked nice, and I have used the Radiance Cream to good effect (see here), but the blush is a great everyday makeup essential.  It\u2019s easy to apply and blend, for a start \u2013 fingertips or, if you don\u2019t mind cross-contaminating your makeup tools with a million different products, your foundation brush. I quite like using the same brush to do primer (if I\u2019m bothering), foundation and then cream bronzers and blushers. If I\u2019m having a dry day and using powders then I\u2019ll have my big powder brushes out (despite Caroline Barnes telling me off and instructing me to use more precise, smaller-headed brushes!) but on a creamier, dewier-face day the Bobbi Brown Full Coverage Brush sees a lot of action.  Then there\u2019s the tawny, sort of autumnal shade. Completely unseasonal, it\u2019s sort of the beauty equivalent of eating asparagus at Christmas, but who the hell cares? I\u2019ve been wearing a lot of pretty pink recently, and this just feels a little more grown-up and sophisticated. Doesn\u2019t have the same youthful flush, I suppose, and that cheeky flash of brightness that seems to light up the eyes and make everything look that bit perkier, but it certainly feels polished and sexy.  It reminds me a little of the cheek shade I used in a Tom Ford video many, many years ago \u2013 it was called Ravish, though looking back, Ravish was a fair bit more gingery and red than this. Camisole Blush is infinitely more wearable and natural (and affordable) so if you\u2019re after a creamy blush to buff in for a bit of posh colour then give this a try.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve mentioned why Givenchy is one of my most treasured beauty brands before \u2013 as a 18 year old doe-eyed beauty fanatic I landed an internship at the Givenchy PR HQ and it was by far one of the most memorable experiences. I leapt to work everyday, eagerly unpacked the latest launches and couldn\u2019t wait to draft a new press release. It was one of the key events that really cemented my passion for beauty. In fact, I have a dedicated drawer to my special Givenchy beauty products that I was kindly given during my stay that I label too precious to use!  Back to Paris, where we were given the 411 on so many upcoming launches. Firstly fragrance, Live Irresistible, a fresh and fruity, and young fragrance perfect for welcoming Spring. For men there\u2019s Gentleman Only Parisian Break, which is by far one of my most favourite mens fragrances of all time (and which now remains at my Boyfriend\u2019s house as it\u2019s his current favourite too!). Onto the makeup, Les Saisons. Givenchy collections make me a little weak in the knees as their face palettes and powders never disappoint. Firstly there\u2019s Poudre Bonne Minne, essentially a bronzer but described as having a baked liquid gel formula. The main aim being to enhance and illuminate the skin, it almost gives a sheeny finish, it\u2019s so incredibly gorgeous I can\u2019t wait to sport this with minimal makeup on holiday. It\u2019s one of those sweep and go \u2013 instant fabulous products.   Cushion Kiss is one of the most exciting launches, it\u2019s a balm-gloss hybrid that offers a high shine finish. It has a super fun applicator that\u2019s a round squishy ball and the product comes out of the centre. Below I\u2019m wearing Coral Kiss, they don\u2019t impart too much pigment just a light, easy wash of colour. They\u2019ve expanded their MISTER RADIANT collection to include a blush and highlighter. It\u2019s one of the most unique products I\u2019ve ever used as it\u2019s a gel formula with microbeads that almost pop under the pressure of fingers and releases a luminous pigment. Nothing too harsh or hard to work with but adds a soft glow.   Lastly are two releases I\u2019m in love with, the Kohl Couture Waterproof, a twist up eyeliner with a really creamy long wearing formula. You\u2019ll see this pop up in multiple videos very soon! And the Noir Couture Volume Waterproof which is a really lengthening mascara, both of which I\u2019m wearing in the picture above. Overall I think my favourites have to be the Bonne Minne Powder, Cushion Kiss \u0026 Gentleman Only Parisian Break fragrance. All the products launch next month (April) and are available from Harrods here.","date":"1458223818","title":"NEW IN GIVENCHY BEAUTY","media":"http:\/\/amelialiana.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/b3-min.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/amelialiana.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/b3-min.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmFtZWxpYWxpYW5hLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGYjMtbWluLmpwZw==?checksum=33306395a48d9d2c3305984e770db8df135b6398\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Liana Beauty","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4797525791\u0026blog=6498215\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/6498215\/4797525791","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/liana-beauty-6498215\/new-in-givenchy-beauty-4797525791","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/liana-beauty-6498215\/new-in-givenchy-beauty-4797525791","likes":1},"4779826740:6498215":{"post_id":"4779826740","blog_id":"6498215","link":"http:\/\/amelialiana.com\/2016\/03\/the-little-cat-bag\/","content":"My Charlotte Olympia cat shoes are probably the most commented on piece of clothing in my wardrobe but believe it or not there\u2019s something even cuter than that I have got to show you \u2013 the matching handbag.

The gorgeous velvet, the cute gold strap (which FYI you can remove to wear as a clutch if you wish) and the way it\u2019s always smiling at you. I have to say there\u2019s not all that much you can fit in here, some keys, cards, lipgloss \u2013 the necessities but I love the feeling of just having my basics with me and plus \u2013 she\u2019s so cute! Moving onto this coat which you may have spotted in a few vlogs \u2013 by a brand called Jakke. On first look I thought it would be far too bright and bold for a predominately black-wearer like myself but it just adds something bright and colourful to my day instantly. It\u2019s super warm and cosy too.  Lastly are these babies you may have spotted on my instagram, my YSL tassle booties. The perfect thick heel for walking around, sassy tassels to add some extra oomph to the shoe and with a gorgeous lace up at the front (which does take more than a few seconds to do up if you\u2019re used to slipping on boots but so so worth it).

Firstly I was in Paris with YSL, which is a huge honour in itself, but on Tuesday morning I was in a taxi headed to the Parisienne countryside, being taken to YSL Lipstick Factory. We were going to see the making of one of my all time favourite lipsticks \u2013 the Rouge Volupt\u00e9 Shine.    Going to a lipstick factory was something I had only ever dreamt about and I spent days and nights wondering what exactly was going to happen and how much we would be let into. It was a surreal experience being in the very hub of where YSL make and ship their Rouge Volupt\u00e9 Shine lipsticks worldwide. Of course I vlogged every moment as I couldn\u2019t wait to share it with you! I\u2019ve linked my vlog below so I hope you enjoy it!

They\u2019ve brought out a range all about how to sculpt the face, with the help of multiple different products that I couldn\u2019t wait to share with you.  There are 5 products in the range and each one is more exciting and innovative than the next. Let\u2019s start with the Infallible Sculpt Base, which has been designed to be used specifically before sculpting. Available in two shades, the formula is much lighter than a foundation but still adds a light coverage and luminous look to the skin. It contains \u2018grip technology\u2019 to help ensure the sculpt products adhere well onto the skin and claims to last up to 24 hours (although I never keep my makeup on that long!). For me the next product, Infallible Sculpt Palette, is the star of the show. It\u2019s a duo sculpting kit with one darker shade to add dimension to the face, and a lighter shade to highlight. It\u2019s available in two shades and I\u2019ve been using the darker of the two as I like a more chiseled look. With a cream to powder formula they\u2019ve really combined the best of both worlds as the cream effect gives a super natural look on the skin whereas the powder finish ensures long lasting qualities.   To apply and blend in the product I\u2019ve been using the Sculpting Brush, with the flat side of the brush to apply the contour and the curved side to apply the highlight. It\u2019s a synthetic brush which makes it perfect for picking up and distributing the right amount of product onto the face and makes blending in as easy as can be. As shown above, I use the dark shade in the hollows of the cheeks, on my temples and just below my jaw line. I\u2019ve applied the lighter shade on the high-points of the face like down the centre of my nose, the top of my cheekbones and a little in the centre of my forehead. Both shades are matte so have a really natural finish on the skin once blended. For adding colour and an extra pop of highlight there\u2019s the Infallible Sculpt Blush, with three shades in each blush you can use it whichever way you like. I\u2019ve either been dipping my brush in all three or using each individual shade for a pop of colour. I\u2019ve been loving the shade Soft Rosy (middle) as it gives a gorgeous flush and has a slight sheen to it which really illuminates the cheeks. Lastly is the Infallible Sculpt False Lash Mascara, which has one of the most unique wands I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s designed to help tightline the lashes whilst voluminising and adding shape and structure to each lash. I love the fanned out effect the wing of the brush gives as it really lifts my eyes. There\u2019s an exciting competition in partnership with Superdrug where you could win\u00a32,000 shopping vouchers (on Love2Shop), Entire L\u2019Oreal Paris make up range (worth \u00a32,500) with total value worth is \u00a34,500. To enter: take a colour close of picture wearing L\u2019Oreal Paris Infallible Sculpt Palette on your face, before blending the product in (like the picture above) and submit it via Facebook, twitter or instagram and make sure to #SculptYourWay. The competition will run from the 10th of February till the 9th of March (please check T\u0026C\u2019s here) Stay tuned for my video coming in a couple of days to see the products in greater detail and for London meetup details!

The other day I was driving with Christian and his cousins and we were all getting a little tired and cranky so I turned on some fun music and started bouncing around and singing my heart out. At first they all just looked at me like I was weird and crazy and Crush expressed concern that I was \u201cdancing and driving\u201d but before long they were all joining in, smiling and laughing. Ever since I had kids I haven\u2019t been as much into music as I was before, I think mostly because *quiet* is such a hot commodity these days. But man, a good song and a little goofy dancing can really make you feel like a million bucks in a hurry:) It has taken me a Reeeeaaaallly long time to jump on board with the long lasting matte lip colors because I\u2019m totally phobic of dry lips and mine dry out very easily. So I still don\u2019t use them regularly but being able to have lip color that stays on FOREVER is so nice sometime. This pretty pink Kat Von D tube is my favorite so far. (color: Melancholia)  THIS Dress sold out so quickly after I bought it last year. It\u2019s been such a great find. So flattering, flowy and hangs softly (no grasping or clinging to undergarments and skin) and it goes with anything and could be worn to anything. The great news is, it finally came back into stock! YAY! I had to share before it\u2019s gone again:) Do you have a steamer? cause if not, you need one! I HATE ironing and this little bad boy has been life changing. I swear I had a whole corner of my closet that was collecting dust because it required an iron, ironing board, ironing skills and baby endangerment in order to be in wearable shape. Not anymore my friends, turn on my steamer and 2 minutes later it\u2019s good to go! How amazingly cute is this swimming suit? And it\u2019s totally affordable too. I just ordered it:) I hope you guys have a great weekend, I so appreciate you stopping by today!  \u00a0  M A S K C A R A C O S M E T I C S  ","date":"1457695627","title":"Friday Favorites","media":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.maskcara.com\/maskcara\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/dance.jpg?resize=564%2C565","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.maskcara.com\/maskcara\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/dance.jpg?resize=564%2C565","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmkxLndwLmNvbSUyRnd3dy5tYXNrY2FyYS5jb20lMkZtYXNrY2FyYSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjAzJTJGZGFuY2UuanBnJTNGcmVzaXplJTNENTY0JTI1MkM1NjU=?checksum=b2018304af0a72782ac5f776be8bcad94276f561\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Maskcara","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4789132230\u0026blog=2673694\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2673694\/4789132230","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/maskcara-2673694\/friday-favorites-4789132230","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/maskcara-2673694\/friday-favorites-4789132230","likes":4},"4776325140:2673694":{"post_id":"4776325140","blog_id":"2673694","link":"http:\/\/www.maskcara.com\/2016\/03\/02\/hawaii-baby\/","content":"We had such a wonderful time on our vacation this year! Last year was a blast but we were right in the middle of a few delays on our newly released product (something we had no way of knowing when we made the reservations!) so I still spent a lot of the time at the computer working through emails and begging delivery services to rush. This time around I was more \u201cunhooked\u201d than I think I\u2019ve ever been for that long! It was so fun and refreshing and good to just enjoy family and friends but by the end I was starting to really miss it! It\u2019s such a huge blessing to be able to love your work as much as you love your play:) I\u2019ve had a bunch of people ask for recommendations for the Island. I\u2019ve only been twice now but I\u2019ve been given some amazing recommendations so I\u2019m thrilled to pass them along to any of you who have a Hawaiian trip in your future! We stayed on the North Shore at Turtle Bay so most of the recs are in that area. First of all we found this amazingly fun and picturesque swing right next to the water. The kids loved it and the photos are some of my favorites ever! (It was right off the main road about 5 miles north of the PCC)     Shave Ice. It was controversial in our group which shave ice was the best. I voted The Aloha General Store \u0026 Nick was all about Matsumoto\u2019s, both are pretty incredible!  We visited the LDS Temple and walked around the visitors center, it is so pretty. Isn\u2019t my mom lovely?  Sunset pillbox hike. This hike made for such a beautiful view and was a really good choice for kids (we left Billy back with grandparents because he refuses to stay in the baby backpack but if your kid will for sure bring them!)  This t-shirt is one of my absolute favorites BTW. I have it in like 4 colors. It is a flattering cut, such soft fabric and (best of all!) it actually washes well! I\u2019ve washed them a bunch of times and they haven\u2019t faded, thinned or misshapen which is more than I can say for most of my tees. Get one here (AE) For 20 bucks. Lanikai Beach in Kailua. The waves were pretty hardcore on the North end of the island so we went to this beach and it was perfect and so pretty. Surfing. Here again the waves were to crazy for beginners so we went to Waikiki to surf. It was SO packed but the waves were great (so long as you didn\u2019t run someone over!)  I had this overwhelming urge to scoot around on this baby and couldn\u2019t convince anyone to join me until the last day! We got them from Hele Huli, they were awesome.  It was so much fun and I obviously looked SO cool doing it:) Buuuut..my friend Jill who I totally talked into coming ended up taking a slide in the gravel with hers and got pretty beat up. I felt so awful! She\u2019s OK but got some scrapes and bruises. I will say to ride around a bit and get comfortable with the turns and the breaks before taking on the faster roads. We definitely should have done that. Her Ray Bans didn\u2019t survive, we found them just like this after the crash.  Places to eat: Kua\u2019aina Burger \u2013 If you love fresh avocados their avocado burger CANNOT be beat and their shoestring fries are AMAZING. Ted\u2019s Bakery \u2013 Holy HANNAH! Best donuts of my life! Lei Lei\u2019s \u2013 If you wanna have a night out this place is delicious. It\u2019s a little pricey so we just snuck away there for a date one of the nights and left the kids with the grandparents:) The pork loin is FANTASTIC. Giovanni\u2019s Shrimp Trucks \u2013 Full disclosure I wasn\u2019t a huge fan, the food was good but I couldn\u2019t handle the fishy smell. Everyone else really liked it though, so I thought I\u2019d add it for shrimp lovers. Waialua Bakery and Juice bar \u2013 Really good Acai bowls here and I really liked the set-up. I\u2019d love if any of you who have them would add their recommendations below!

She is so beautiful I couldn\u2019t stop myself from asking her if she\u2019d let me have a go at her makeup. She\u2019s not used to wearing a whole bunch of it so I wanted to keep it very simple and soft. Her young daughters came to watch and their commentary was hilarious! They loved it, Anna loved it too I think also it always takes a little getting used to at first:)  What I used: Maskcara Foundation in Aura highlight + Ash contour + Petal blush (not released yet!) + honey I used Petal on her cheeks and lips because it\u2019s a very pale (almost lavender) pink, because of her skin tone everything goes very warm on her which I often just go with and do something warm and golden, it\u2019s kind of the easiest most obvious choice. In this case though I really wanted to do a little bit of a contrast and use the cooler tones to brighten her complexion. Lined her lips with my fav sebastian pencil Surprisingly I used UD Brow Beater in dark brown on her brows. I often see red heads going with more warm orangy tones on their brows but I have found that it can go too warm and looks unnatural and distracting. I tend to use dark colors on their brows that aren\u2019t the slightest bit warm and their skin tone warms and lightens it right up! I used a soft creamy shimmer (Girly from Colourpop) on her lids and a gorgeous set of Esqido lashes in Oh So Sweet the lashes create a dark enough line so I didn\u2019t really need any liner at all. Hope you had a good week last week! Love you! OH and happy leap day!   M A S K C A R A C O S M E T I C S  ","date":"1456746153","title":"Makeover Monday on a MONDAY!

She is so kind and genuine and has such a big heart! I love spending time with her because her positivity and excitement for life is 100% contagious! Sometimes spending time with people who are negative and gossipy can be kind of fun in the moment because they can be pretty funny and interesting but I always feel a little deflated afterward. When you spend time with positive genuine people that good feeling lingers. It\u2019s good to remember for me because I\u2019m so analytical and I love to talk about every thing but it\u2019s just sooo easy to delve into the negative. It takes practice to try to stay positive and I don\u2019t think it means you always have to be in denial or something, most the time it\u2019s just about switching your the perspective. Anyway\u2026 On to the makeover! I know that Sadie does photos a lot and gets her makeup done by the mega pros fairly often so I wanted to do something different she hadn\u2019t ever tried before. So I went really smokey on her eyes (I swear the photo doesn\u2019t look half as smoky as it really was!   Photos by Jessica Janae What I used: Brows: UD Brow Beater Pencil in Dark Brown.

First up is the high end treat - Swiss brand\u00a0Valmont\u0027s Prime Renewing Pack\u00a0(available\u00a0here). I arrived in Paris last month for a huge event and, when I got to my hotel, tried to book in for a last minute facial as I was feeling frazzled and decidedly blah. They couldn\u0027t fit me in but the therapist very enthusiastically recommended this mask as a quick fix. It\u0027s a very good salon with good therapists I\u0027ve used in the past so I was all ears, but I\u0027m always skeptical and wasn\u0027t 100% convinced. Anyway, tiredness and knowing I had to look fabulous quickly made me desperate, so I bought it... nothing ventured, nothing gained. I applied a thick layer, left it for about 15 minutes (there was a bit of tingling, but nothing uncomfortable) then tissued and rinsed off the excess. Sure enough it really did noticeably plump up and tighten my skin and even the next morning it still looked\u00a0uber-glowy, fresh and rested (and the results seemed to last into the following day, too).\u00a0You can also apply it in a thin layer as a pre-makeup base, and if you have drier skin you could leave it on overnight as a treatment. It contains some good peptides, ginseng and lots of humectants (to plump!). If you\u0027re someone who prefers to avoid mineral oil then this won\u0027t be for you as it\u0027s in there, however you can apply and rinse off like I did, rather than leaving it on your skin. I\u0027ve had a look around and prices really vary - I bought mine at the hotel premium price for about \u20ac170 (approx. \u00a3130 \/ $190) but I\u0027ve also spotted some online for closer to \u00a3100.

But I don\u0027t really believe that makeup trends exist anymore - its more a case of the same looks and styles coming around again and again. The thing that makes a trend different each time is the technology - i.e. packaging, delivery and formula. A really good example is the cushion phenomenon from Asia, which is all about the delivery system of lightweight textures that give skin a luminous, dewy look - you could say that this is a trend, but it\u0027s come very much via technology. Another technology trend that\u0027s been bubbling to the surface over the past year is the return of gloss textures. Lip gloss has always been an intrinsic part of my kit, for editorial shoots, fashion shows and campaigns, but in real life it\u0027s something that\u0027s been out of fashion for a while, especially after the overkill of gloss in the 80s and 90s (who didn\u0027t have a\u00a0Juicy Tube or glitter-flecked gloss in their handbag back then?!).\u00a0Heavy, sticky textures also gave gloss a bad rep but now, thanks to huge advances in technology, the new crop of glosses deliver shine, tint and moisture in a whole new way - no more gloopy formulas or tacky (literally and metaphorically) finishes.

Reading it back, the subject matter seemed just as relevant today as it did when it was written so I thought I\u2019d let it see the light of day here. \u00a0 Whilst the beauty trends of the 1920s are as easily recognisable as the fashion, it seems we\u2019re rattling towards to 2020\u2019s with a thoroughly indiscernible \u2018look\u2019. The beauty icons of old have been replaced with an amalgamation of aspirational aesthetic goals (a post-Coachella tan, poreless skin, etc.) \u2013 many of which don\u2019t, or pretend not to, involve makeup. Even beauty brand ambassadors seem to have become a transient stream of barely made-up celebrities; Bobbi Brown recently replaced the fresh-faced Katie Holmes with the, err, fresh-faced Kate Upton. This surge in popularity for barely-there makeup was cemented on Vogue\u2019s April 2014 cover, with Nigella Lawson\u2019s toned-down (post-court case \u2018war paint\u2019) makeup acknowledged as heralding a new chapter in her life. With skincare sales in the US growing to $3.6 billion in 2013, and the craze for BB and CC (beauty balm and colour corrector respectively) leaving brands clamouring to clear shelf space for these minimal coverage bases, it seems we\u2019re all chasing a naturally flawless finish \u2013 but is the \u2018look\u2019 of 2014 really as barefaced as the hashtags would have us believe? Despite being fully immersed in the beauty industry on a daily basis, I\u2019ve found myself wearing less and less makeup. While I\u2019m passionate about colour cosmetics as a form of self-expression, a mood and confidence booster, I\u2019m ok with not looking perky 24\/7. I\u2019m generally only fully made-up for nights out, or simply when the mood strikes me, and I relish days when I have a couple of spare hours to really experiment with pencils and lipstick. However the freedom and lack of obligation I feel around makeup is frequently called into question by responses to my semi-bare face; if I skip foundation my dad never fails to tell me I look \u2018washed out\u2019, and female acquaintances struggle to conceal their bewilderment about how I can possibly call myself a beauty writer without sporting full face to work. As Vogue\u2019s almost-barefaced Nigella cover attests, there\u2019s both a demand for and supply of slap-free celebrities. Where dark circles and pimples once appeared spitefully ringed with red, freshly cleansed famous faces are now ostensibly making a wilful statement. Like the #nomakeupselfie movement, this rejection of the airbrushed status quo has been portrayed as everything from a declaration of togetherness and girl-power, to a push towards improved self-esteem; but the reality reveals a complicated relationship between women and makeup (and men). Blogger, Leandra Medine (aka The Man Repeller), recently penned a piece in which she explained why she didn\u2019t feel the need to wear makeup. The post was in response to, amongst other things, an unfortunate cc: email incident in which a male website founder said she was funny and smart, but \u2018ugly as f*ck\u2019. It was a piece Leandra was clearly reluctant to write as, she rightly observes, her website doesn\u2019t \u2018sell bodies\u2019 but \u2018ideas\u2019. Despite the positive conclusion, her writing (and the comments below) drew attention to a marked anxiety about men\u2019s perception of makeup-free female faces. While most men I know would happily admit they can\u2019t spot the difference between a bare face and \u2018natural\u2019 makeup, hashtags drawing attention to the absence of cosmetics have produced mixed responses. To quote one misfiring compliment I saw on a photo during the recent \u2018breast cancer awareness\u2019 selfie-spree; \u2018Oh, you\u2019re actually quite pretty without makeup\u2019. It seems, particularly for young teens, there\u2019s a perception that our entire being and worth somehow shifts with the removal of makeup. You need only search one of these hashtags on Instagram to bring up thousands of photos (63,621 at time of writing) of girls accompanied by comments consisting almost entirely of variants on \u2018you\u2019re so brave\u2019. Though the #nomakeup hashtag itself is arguably both reductive and sexist, particularly in the case of cancer awareness, perhaps worse still is that it\u2019s often coupled with connotations (or #real) that those who do choose to wear makeup are somehow now inferior or \u2018fake\u2019. If we adopt that thinking, the current trend for \u2018no-makeup makeup\u2019 is the most dishonest of all. Though the more \u2018bare\u2019 faces we see in print and across social media (like most, I see plenty in day-to-day life) may push towards an adjustment in the way all genders view makeup (as a source of pleasure rather than with a feeling of necessity), there\u2019s new pressure to sport the sort of glowing skin that suggests a wholesome life of Wholefoods trips, kale juice and ashtanga yoga \u2013 and this pressure to look \u2018naturally\u2019 perfect is being felt by all genders. Since 2008, the market for men\u2019s toiletries has grown by 15%, and is expected to boom another 13% by 2018. With Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs now selling dedicated lines of men\u2019s colour cosmetics, this decade\u2019s dalliance with men\u2019s makeup looks set to extend beyond Johnny Depp-inspired \u2018guyliner\u2019. Though, with any luck, this won\u2019t be the start of boyfriends reluctant to nip to the shop without concealer, steps towards normalisation for men who do want to experiment with cosmetics is debatably a positive thing. Conflicts aside, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that the combined effort of the #nomakeup selfies and un-retouched celebrities will result in a positive shift towards a more balanced perception of makeup for all genders. Whether you\u2019re sporting a red lip daily, or just for your office Christmas do, maybe the biggest beauty trend of 2014 will be the one where we\u2019re finally all doing as we damn well please.

Those memories become even harder to hang on to when you\u2019re weighed down by the jet lagged fogginess that hovers for the first few days, made worse by the humidity (July is the tail end of the rainy season) and aggressive hum of cicadas \u2013 only briefly lifting when I came face to face with a Giant Hornet the size of my fist on a hike. But, in a nutshell, Japan is the most fascinating, conflicting, confusing yet strangely comforting place I\u2019ve visited; all at once impossibly modern and rigidly archaic. I can\u2019t wait to go back.  (Yep, that\u2019s 100% a photo of the toilet buttons\u2026be careful which one you press.) We flew with Lufthansa from London via Munich to Tokyo Haneda, with a travel time of about 15hrs. If, like us, your budget stipulates an indirect economy flight, it\u2019s a good choice for comfort and minimal risk of being stranded in an obscure airport \u2013 good news for not-so-calm flyers like me. But I\u2019d recommend comparing prices on SkyScanner.  A few tips\u2026 Exchange currency before you go. An obvious tip for some, but I rarely bother for the \u2018card-culture\u2019 European countries I visit most. Taking out cash in Japan can be tricky \u2013 ATMs tend to be limited to post offices and 7 Elevens and some international cards aren\u2019t accepted. Japan is a safe place to carry cash and it\u2019s much easier to have Yen available\u2026particularly a few \u00a5100 ready to buy cold Royal Milk Tea (the withdrawals are real) or ramen from a vending machine at every given opportunity. Get a portable WiFi device. Despite being a hub of technology, there\u2019s still not a huge free WiFi culture in Japan. Where street signs are only in kanji, having free and easy access to Google maps will make life much easier. CityMapper also has a (relatively new) Tokyo setting. We hired a device from Global Advanced Communications and just popped it in the post on our way back to the airport. Learn a little Japanese. English is taught and spoken widely (and is getting a bit of a push pre-2020 Tokyo Olympics), but it\u2019s helpful to learn a bit of Japanese before you travel. I really lack confidence with languages, but you\u2019ll be amazed how far you can get with \u2018arigato gozaimasu\u2019 (thank you very much) and a smile in Japan. Some light reading on general etiquette is a must too, particularly if you\u2019re visiting temples. Buy a JR pass before you travel. Japan\u2019s rail network is incredible \u2013 fast, reliable and air conditioned. The JR pass can only be bought outside of Japan and gives visitors access to almost all JR lines across the islands. It\u2019s a bit of a hefty expense to begin with, but gives you complete freedom. A couple of trips on the Shinkansen (bullet train) and you\u2019ll have pretty much recouped your money. Pack smart. The humidity and heat were a killer and, if you\u2019re visiting in summer, don\u2019t even think about packing anything but cotton or silk. Regardless of the season, I\u2019d suggest packing your favourite trainers. We clocked up almost 20km per day during our trip and walking is one of the best ways to see as much as possible. For most of our visit, we stayed in Yokohama with my boyfriend\u2019s brother and sister-in-law who very kindly put us up, translated emails during some Typhoon disruption (more on that later), advised us on what to see, do and eat.  Yokohama Yokohama is about 30-40 minutes from Tokyo city centre on train lines included in the JR pass and accommodation can be a little cheaper than Tokyo, so it\u2019s worth bearing in mind as an alternative. Where to go We travelled into Tokyo most days, but there\u2019s plenty to see in and around Yokohama too (including a cup noodle museum\u2026but we gave that a miss). It\u2019s also a bit more chilled than Tokyo, so spending some time around Yokohama city centre is a pretty good way to get acclimatised. Even seemingly normal activities like bowling become a unique experience in Japan. Kamakura Though not *technically* in Yokohama, Kamakura is a short trip south and home to numerous Shinto shrines, Zen temples and a giant Buddha. The main shopping street is worth a visit for ceramics, fabrics and traditional Japanese sweets and crackers, but we spent most time around the Kenchoji temple before hiking up into the hills behind it for amazing views over the entire temple grounds. From certain perspectives there are no modern buildings in sight, so it\u2019s incredibly easy to imagine \u2018Old Japan\u2019.  Sankeien Gardens We spent a couple of hours wandering around these peaceful gardens, built by a silk trader and tea ceremony enthusiast at the turn of the 20th century. The ridiculously elegant, sprawling grounds made a pretty good crash course in traditional architecture and horticultural design.  Where to eat As I expected, Japan is incredible for food \u2013 but probably a nightmare for fussy eaters. A lot of our meals were on the move, onigiri (\u00a5100\/53p) and ice cold green tea from the local supermarket make a great breakfast, but here\u2019s a few places we liked in and around Yokohama. Yoshinoya This basic, cheap but tasty chain can be found in most cities and became a favourite for quick, easy meals. It\u2019s a particular haunt for gamer boys who\u2019ve emerged from neighbouring arcades to down a bowl of gy\u016bdon before heading back to hit a high score. Their signature dish is a really filling \u2018beef bowl\u2019 on steamed rice which comes in at about \u00a33. Mutenkurazushi Part of a chain of conveyor belt sushi restaurants, Mutenkurazushi was really busy when we visited and understandably so \u2013 it\u2019s family friendly (read: unfancy), all of the plates are \u00a5100 and the seared salmon nigiri is delicious. Din Tai Fung We paid a visit to the Yokohama branch of this Taiwanese dim sum place a visit at the end of our trip. It\u2019s hidden away on the top floor of the Takashimaya department store and serves amazing Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). Considering the Taipei branch has a Michelin star, it\u2019s also really reasonable.

But it\u2019s not just gyms that are offering a way to balance a little self care with some kind of social life. My latest find (and now my answer to \u2018where does the best manicure in London?\u2019) DryBy is, they say, a \u2018social space which caters for modern women\u2019. Designed to do away with beauty destinations that are either too much like a conveyer belt (though there\u2019s much to be said for the brusque efficiency of the slightly divey place I tend to opt for when it comes to gel nails), or too stuffy and pretentious to make you feel at ease lingering over that second cup of coffee, sisters Krisztina van der Boom and Anita Puluczkai have created an open space that works as as both an hair and nail bar and social hub.  Offering a short but well executed menu of nail treatments and blow dries, DryBy is conveniently tucked away behind Oxford Circus (beside the fitness haunt of fashion-y types, Psycle) and its appeal is very much helped by the clean decor. From the putty coloured Anglepoise lamps to the blush chairs and gold lined foot bowls, the pared-back but welcoming femininity of the place makes you want to stay for hours and have every treatment going. And those treatments don\u2019t disappoint; I had the most precise manicure of my life courtesy of Emilia. DryBy use Soign\u00e9, Nailberry and Lauren B polishes, all 5 free and laid out in a range of beautiful shades. I opted for Nailberry \u2018Mystere\u2019, a light lilac-grey and as promised it looked perfect for 5 days \u2013 despite my weak nails. Starting at \u00a321, the nail treatments aren\u2019t the cheapest going in London but if (like me) you mostly DIY your manicures, they\u2019re more than worth it for the end result and indulgent half hour in the lovely surroundings.  I have a feeling DryBy will be my go-to nail salon from now on and, with a few new engagements, I\u2019ll no doubt suggesting this as a slightly more civilised Hen party hangout or pre-wedding treat.

It doesn\u0027t promise enlivened bounce, dazzling shine, or a surge of hydration. It promises clean hair and scalp\u2014and therein lies it\u0027s value. I discovered this back in my dance recital years where \u0022performance hair\u0022 meant multiple layers of [L.A Looks Hair Gel](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664713131152671), matted down with a boar bristle brush, spray painted with [Suave Hair Spray](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664754894012094), and finished off with a toothbrush on the baby hairs. Post-performance was decidedly less glamourous; looking like a human again required several shampooings using the basic, yet effective [Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664849105552226). Now that the \u0022go as long as possible without washing your hair\u0022 method is less trend and more just normal behavior, clarifying shampoo on the whole has leveled up. If you\u0027re only washing your hair once or twice a week, you\u0027re going to want clarifying shampoo\u0027s ability to remove dirt, oil, and product build-up from your scalp and roots. It\u0027ll keep your hair healthier\u2014not to mention easier to style. If you\u0027ve ever asked yourself, [\u0022Has my shampoo stopped working?\u0022](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2014\/06\/oily-hair-shampoo\/) you\u0027re going to want try one of the shampoos listed below: __The one that is the Gloffice favorite:__ [Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub with Sea Salt](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664890284609653) was Sephora\u0027s best-selling shampoo in France last year. Now, it\u0027s well on its way to being their best-seller in America, too. We\u0027d like to say that it\u0027s because it\u0027s stationed in the showers of most French [Top Shelves](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/category\/the-top-shelf\/), but it\u0027s probably because of its gentle grit. The salt scrubs off buildup, while also tending to sensitive scalps. Bonus: The tub lasts for ages. __The one that\u0027s most fun to use:__ [Oribe The Cleanse Clarifying Shampoo](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664953715563224) (the [conditioner pairing](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664997371925489) is excellent). This was first introduced to me a few months ago by [James Pecis](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2016\/01\/easy-braids\/). He stopped by the office with a tiny sample can, asked us to put out our hands, and blasted us with the gray-black mousse. It foams up just like shaving cream, and contains ~volcanic ash powder~. Points for originality here. __The one that smells like sweet, sweet youth:__ [Frederic Fekkai Apple Cider](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565665126356373551). The bright green color and juicy green apple scent reminds me of Garnier Fructis, but a whole lot chicer. Recommended usage is once a week. A little goes a long way with this one, therefore expect it to be a happy mainstay in your shower for 6-12 months. __The one that looks grown up:__ [Davines Solu](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565665170511767127). Great, simple, utilitarian packaging. I used this guy after a night out wearing a super slick, shellacked high pony \u00e0 la Balmain S\/S \u002716. The smell is whatever, but I can fully attest that there was not a single strand of hair on my head that felt crunchy or crusty after using. __The one that I already mentioned:__ [Neutrogena Anti-Residue]((http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565664849105552226)). Under $10, and a product that does the job. Tried and true, \u0027nuff said. __The one that makes your hair shiny__: [Moroccanoil Clarify](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565665242477822921). You know how your hair feels terrific when you get an amazing shampooing at the salon? That soft, shiny, smooth effect is attainable with just one use of this shampoo.

It\u2019s a good candidate for one of those zippily-edited late night show bits where Jimmy Fallon stands outside and asks passersby to define something fundamental to our vocabulary but yet somehow strangely elusive. What\u2019s the difference between primaries and caucuses? Or, what\u2019s a calorie? You try to answer and you realize the comfort with which you drop term in conversation is not the same as fact. \u201cUhm, it\u2019s like, how much like energy is, like, in there?\u201d With collagen, my mind immediately associates it with squishiness. The nice plump, squishy part of the skin. More collagen makes more squishiness. (Right?) My research told me a bit more\u2014that it\u2019s found deep in the dermis all throughout the skin, and more concentrated in connective tissues like tendons and ligaments. That it\u2019s what leaches out in your bone broth after three days on the boil. And it\u2019s the chief ingredient in a few products I was testing at the moment\u2014one topical, the [Mizon Collagen 100](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565506858179976255), and one internal, [Minerva Pure Gold Collagen Drinks](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565506895112805467). For weeks, I\u2019d been marinating in the stuff. And I liked it. This all came from a personal need, a professional inquiry, and an editor who encouraged a deeper dive than just the first page of Google results. For a while, I\u2019ve had a creeping feeling that my skin\u2019s starting look thinner and a bit craggier in a way that an extra layer of moisturizer can\u2019t quite address. I instinctively felt collagen must be the answer, that it might act as caulking for my emerging lines. Oh, and the squishiness\u2014more of that please. The initial testing phase began with supplements. Because I like to keep my experiences experiential, I opted for a drink. PURE GOLD COLLAGEN, it says. Inside, it\u2019s pinkish, viscous, and that just-slightly-too-much quantum of a double-shot. Knock it back in a staggered one-and-a-half gulps, and you get that sort of pre-nausea you can see in Neo\u2019s eyes after he takes the red pill. There\u2019s a sort of, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d feeling to it. The collagen seems to have come courtesy of tilapia. Results-wise, there were some developments that couldn\u0027t be chalked up to a topical serum. Curiously\u2014and perhaps psychosomatically\u2014enough, I felt like certain areas of my face were plusher, jellier. When I brushed sleep out the inner corners of my eyes, there was a bouncier, cushier touch to those little triangular ducts. My fingernails shone like they\u2019ve been buffed. Cuticles and chapped lips healed right up. It felt like there was more of me, right where I wanted it. But subjectivity can\u2019t go unchecked forever. And that\u2019s why the wise beauty editor will often direct the enthusiastic researcher (that\u2019s me) to go out and \u201cget a quote\u201d\u2014usually in the form of an off-the-books visit to a dermatologist I could never otherwise afford. For this assignment, that role was played by Dr. Amy Wechsler, who charms out of a Central Park-adjacent practice on the Upper East Side. The waiting room is one of those demure, understatedly decorated affairs that just smells like you just missed Julianne Moore. I had my putative results, my earnest if not overly technical research, and my newly casual approach to the term \u201cfibroblast,\u201d which I thought would come in handy. Amazingly, Dr. Wechsler confirmed my initial instinct about squishiness. \u201cCollagen gives our skin its plumpness,\u201d she said, laying it all out, and gently if obliquely diagnosing my creeping skin blah-ness. \u201cWe start to lose collagen probably around age 18, actually\u2014it starts to slowly diminish.\u201d It\u2019s at this point I realize I\u2019m 10 years past my own #PeakCollagen. Human agency plays a part though. \u201cThere are things we do to our skin or that we\u2019re exposed to that break down collagen more quickly than in the normal aging process.\u201d At which point I started prattling on about my products and my collagen creams. I expected her to be impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think collagen creams work,\u201d Weschler said. I tried to put myself back in my chair. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical. There are a lot of creams on the market that say they do a lot of things and it\u2019s just marketing.\u201d The collagen molecule is notoriously large, and can\u2019t penetrate the dermis, which is where you need it. This is not to say any benefit you might see from a collagen product is psychosomatic or, worse, non-existent. \u201cThere might be some collagen products that are good moisturizers. And if your skin is well-moisturized, it\u2019s going to look great\u2014it\u2019s going to be healthier, look younger\u2014but it\u2019s not because you absorb the collagen.\u201d -- Collagen as the great anti-aging hope fell out of favor a few years back. Injectables were taken off the market, having suffered the twofold trouble of requiring an initial allergy test (being usually derived from pig) and, once injected, only lasting about three months. It was upgraded and replaced en masse by hyaluronic acid fillers like Restylane and Juv\u00e9derm, which required no tests and have more adjustable results. So, if you\u2019re taken with the Kylie look, the injections you thought you were saving up for aren\u2019t collagen at all. In fact, the only collagen injections you can get today are of your own collagen. And at a hefty price. There\u2019s a company called LAVIV (that\u2019s la-veev) that Weschler says she\u2019s worked with before to clear up otherwise-resistant acne scarring in patients. Here\u2019s how the process works: After three behind-the-ear biopsies, the lab\u2019s able to grow up your own individual fibroblasts, which live in the dermis and make collagen and elastin (told you fibroblasts would come into it). These fibroblasts then get injected back into a scar site, and your own skin works to produce more of itself, right where it needs it. Dr. Wechsler says she only turns to this process after she exhausts both topical and laser treatments. \u201cIt\u2019s prohibitively expensive,\u201d she says. So if you can\u2019t eat it, you can\u2019t apply it, and you can\u2019t afford to inject it, preservation is paramount. Wechsler suggests a holistic approach to prevent breakdown, one which she did indeed [write the book on](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565507657241884923). \u201cSleeping enough, no smoking or secondhand smoke, wearing sunscreen\u2014a good broad spectrum one and reapplying it\u2014being really conscious about sun exposure, and keeping your stress level\u2014or cortisol\u2014down as much as possible.\u201d Essentially exercise, sleep, and sex is what I\u2019m hearing. After the interview, I rushed home for my 4pm collagen feeding, even though the doctor shook her head when I mentioned the practice\u2014\u201cAgain, you can\u2019t eat collagen\u201d\u2014feeling a little silly for buying so readily into everything every time. But where would this industry (and, for that matter, my skin) be without a little faint hope and off-label experimentation? If we only did things that had been put through a 20-year trial, wouldn\u2019t we still be 20 years behind? I\u2019m not talking about living dangerously\u2014I\u2019ve still never even eaten that blowfish sushi\u2014but is the hope of collagen cream providing anything beyond moisturization pure delusion? Because the Mizon Collagen Cream I\u2019d been using was changing more than just my mind. Other creams might be chalked up to also-ran moisturizers, but this stuff is like sterling collagen\u201492%\u2014and goes on slippery, the tiniest bit synth-y. Then it absorbs like a dream. It is eye-area rehab in a jar (well, ampule). A little bit of this stuff around your circles, morning and night, and you look as rested as a \u002790s model who now has lots of time to consider her vibrational wavelengths and shit. I used it on my whole face at first, but really saw big things happening in the eye area, and devoted it just to that spot. It\u2019s damn hard, with all the eye creams I\u2019ve been through, to imagine that there\u2019s nothing special to this one. So I reached out again to a slightly more sympathetic expert, though still plenty skeptical one\u2014Peach and Lily Co-Founder [Alicia Yoon](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2015\/04\/alicia-yoon\/). Consider it a second opinion for my wounded illusions. Upon further reflection, it wasn\u2019t very good for my vanity to see two women with such incredible resum\u00e9s and skin in the same week. All in the pursuit of unlined foreheads everywhere\u2026 Turns out the Korean market isn\u2019t so easily baited-and-switched as this stateside one. \u201cConsumers are very skincare-savvy in Korea, and many of them understand that collagen is likely not used by the skin as collagen itself, but it\u0027s an excellent humectant, which helps skin stay healthy,\u201d says Yoon. And she hopes to get collagen through the skin, despite its molecular girth. \u201cMicronized marine collagen is small enough to be absorbed by the skin, and there aren\u0027t any studies yet that show that \u2018chopped up\u2019 collagen can be used by skin cells to build collagen, but this is popular nonetheless because of the moisturizing properties. Some claim that their skin seems to be getting firmer faster than what might be from just well moisturized skin and stick with this religiously. Skincare is all about consistency, and if collagen is something that is making a positive impact on your skin and you can stick to it because you like how it feels, I say, it\u0027s worth it.\u201d A girl after my own heart. For those interested in a measured, hybrid approach, there\u2019s the high-tech natural route, here pioneered by Kat Burki (I was already a devotee before going full collagen Columbo). She makes a serum that smells just like your most redolent middle school memory, [Bath and Body Works\u2019 Cucumber Melon](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565508114983654975). It\u2019s a clear gel that absorbs quickly and lets you power on to your next moisturizing step. Ms. Burki\u2019s kept herself abreast of the collagenous reckonings of late, using keratin, a collagen derived from algae. No delusion here: \u201cCollagen used topically is primarily for cosmetic benefits such as improving the texture of the skin and temporarily filling in fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d Ms. Burki wrote to me over email. Here\u2019s where she pivots into pure beauty gold: \u201cOur [[Marine Collagen Gel](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565509412291570575)] utilizes collagen boosters so you not only get the cosmetic benefits of the lift and fill of the collagen ingredient, but the ingredients such as plant stems cells, silk amino acids, and reishi mushroom have proven effect to increase your own collagen production.\u201d That pivot is indicative of the paradigm in which the new wave of collagen products find themselves\u2014in pursuit of preserving your own collagen, while throwing some actual tiny-molecule versions in for good moisturizing measure, and adding supporting ingredients that urge your own collagen to remake itself in its own image. I\u2019m here to tell you that my own turnover rate is skyrocketing. I don\u2019t want to go back to a de-collagenated serum ever. I don\u2019t mind starting the next 20-year collagen trial, right here, right now. It can\u2019t hurt. And if you\u2019re interested in becoming part of the trial, start with the Mizon. And together we\u2019ll protect our dermal share. The collagen of the future is here\u2014and it really is your own. \u2014Trace Barnhill *Photographed by Tom Newton.* *Knowledge is power: [Get to know your ingredients a little better, here](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/tag\/ingredient-to-know\/).*","date":"1458082800","title":"The Collagen Trials","media":"http:\/\/images.contentful.com\/g8qtv9gzg47d\/6lUOJ2uD3am2iCmIk8eamY\/6bb69d3d05badbb1d55df99f3e78b381\/collagen-beauty-1.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/images.contentful.com\/g8qtv9gzg47d\/6lUOJ2uD3am2iCmIk8eamY\/6bb69d3d05badbb1d55df99f3e78b381\/collagen-beauty-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmltYWdlcy5jb250ZW50ZnVsLmNvbSUyRmc4cXR2OWd6ZzQ3ZCUyRjZsVU9KMnVEM2FtMmlDbUlrOGVhbVklMkY2YmI2OWQzZDA1YmFkYmIxZDU1ZGY5OWYzZTc4YjM4MSUyRmNvbGxhZ2VuLWJlYXV0eS0xLmpwZw==?checksum=9dce10c6f854f1d7e869a51a9ec0ed659021d0c3\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Into The Gloss","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4795905940\u0026blog=2457254\u0026group=0\u0026frame=0\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2457254\/4795905940","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/into-gloss-2457254\/collagen-trials-4795905940","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/into-gloss-2457254\/collagen-trials-4795905940","likes":13},"4795824517:2457254":{"post_id":"4795824517","blog_id":"2457254","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/intothegloss\/VUQZ\/~3\/BGENThiWMaM\/","content":"\u201cWhen I was little, I would take my brothers\u2019 notebooks and draw all the time. I was always into drawing, but drawing fashion specifically. I was telling someone this the other day\u2014I think the reason why I really enjoy clothes and all of that stuff is because I didn\u2019t wear nice things when I was little. Everybody had the cool Gap jeans and stuff, and I had the Old Navy jeans that were on sale. I was very much like, \u2018Oh my gosh\u2026 Those Sketchers are so special but I can\u2019t have them.\u2019 [Laughs] When I graduated from high school, I went to Parsons for Fashion Design. I interned, too, so that whole experience was really cool. What really bothered me about school was how they taught you to design, like it was a formula. \u2018Choose something to be inspired by and design around that.\u2019 I was always like, how do you do that? How do you look at a painting, or how do you look at a building, and automatically feel something and design clothes from that? For me, it\u2019s more about the girl. And it\u2019s personal for me. I designed this puffer jacket because I used to hate puffer jackets when I was little, but I had to wear them, and the feathers would stick out! That\u2019s funny to me, so I\u2019d incorporate that into my clothes. The Sandy Liang girl\u2019s outfits are about her attitude\u2014she has a day where she wants to wear a really big puffer jacket, and she also has a day where she really wants to wear a tweed dress with crystals on it. There has to be some sort of like weird balance, otherwise I don\u2019t feel like myself. When I go out, it\u2019s lipstick and a heel\u2014with really big jeans. Or maybe a dress, but with flat sandals. You will never find me in a tight dress and heels. I really enjoy the process of getting ready because I get to put music on and I get to just be home for awhile. You know FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out? I\u2019m really into JOMO\u2014the Joy Of Missing Out. I haven\u2019t gone out in a really long time, I\u2019ve just been staying in. So tonight I\u2019m just like, \u2018Let\u2019s all go out!\u2019 When I get ready, I start by cleansing with either [Cerave](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565599617281583976) or [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/milky-jelly-cleanser), depending on how I\u2019m feeling. I use the [Foreo Luna](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565599670736225975) to exfoliate. After that, I use [Aesop\u2019s Parsley Seed Toner](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565599690998530357), which smells really nice and kind of medicinal. And then I moisturize with [Cerave Moisturizing Cream](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565599786072493530), which my dermatologist told me to use. I\u2019ll also use the [Skinceuticals Phloretin CF](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565599805348934781), which I actually read about [on an Into The Gloss article](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2016\/01\/skinceuticals-reviews\/). I would use it more often, but the smell is really strong. Then I do [RMS Buriti Bronzer](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602055315953217). I\u2019ve gone through so many pots of it. I fucking love it, and I just apply it to my cheeks. I can\u2019t do blush or foundation or anything too makeup-y on my face, and when I have the bronzer on, because I know it\u2019s natural, I don\u2019t feel guilty wearing it. I can just smear it on, let it melt in, and not really have to think about it. I can\u2019t use any other bronzer. For my eyes, I\u2019ll use [Sephora\u2019s Colorful Shadow and Liner Crayon](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602100879505519) in *Brown*. I like to put that at the very ends of my eyes. And I want to brag\u2014I\u2019ve sort of perfected the cat-eye. I love [Stila Liquid Liner](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602129146263153), it\u2019s the only one I can really use. I can\u2019t handle a pencil. And so many liquid liners are expensive, this is the most reasonable! For mascara, I\u2019ll do that thing where my lashes are just chunky and kind of crazy. I use [Diorshow](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602154919129224) because it\u2019s very dramatic. My going-out makeup is pretty similar to my day makeup, that never really changes. But then I\u2019ll do a lipstick. I have this really, really good [MAC Lipstick](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602226265047249) in *Instigator*. It\u2019s a great plum color, and it\u2019s really matte. I also have a similar [Tom Ford one](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602258122695879). The shade is called *Jay*, but we all know it\u2019s Jay-Z. For Christmas, someone gave me this [Christian Louboutin Lipstick](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602287141486031), and I was like, \u2018What is this like ornament-looking thing? I\u2019m never going to use this, this is ridiculous.\u2019 And then I put it on and it\u2019s the perfect matte, normal lip color. It\u2019s really good. But it\u2019s really expensive. It\u2019s so unlike me, but it\u2019s just perfect. Before I go out, I have to put on perfume, otherwise I feel really weird. I use [Le Labo Gaiac 10](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602330420223115). I used to do the [Santal 33](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565602346497384607), and then I was in a coffee shop reading the New York Times and there was an article about it, and once I read that, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t wear this anymore!\u2019 How late I stay out depends on the night. I\u2019ll usually head home a little earlier, because I need Seamless. And I have to shower every single night\u2014for my hair! I get my hair cut at Shizen and I ask them to cut it choppy\u2014that way I can go to bed with my hair looking fucked up, and then I wake up and it\u2019s perfect. If I wash my hair during the day, it won\u2019t look good when I go out. Asian hair is so coarse that nothing really gets it all texture-y, so I just have to sleep in it. I don\u2019t do anything to it. I don\u2019t even own a hairdryer.\u201d \u2014as told to ITG *Sandy Liang photographed by Tom Newton at her home in New York on February 26, 2015.* *More nights out: [Maayan Zilermann](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2016\/02\/maayan-zilberman\/) chooses the mascara that makes her look most doll-like, [Shiona Turini](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2015\/05\/shiona-turini-consultant\/) perfects the kitchen sink shampoo, and [Karley Sciortino](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2015\/09\/karley-sciortino\/) prefers two-dollar lipsticks to Dior in the [Top Shelf After Dark](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/categories\/top-shelf-after-dark\/).*","date":"1458082800","title":"Sandy Liang, Designer","media":"http:\/\/images.contentful.com\/g8qtv9gzg47d\/5zHamoALN6OwmAciaG8OeY\/9649532484673d4251d4a3d9e6e7d51a\/sandy-liang-designer-11.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/images.contentful.com\/g8qtv9gzg47d\/5zHamoALN6OwmAciaG8OeY\/9649532484673d4251d4a3d9e6e7d51a\/sandy-liang-designer-11.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmltYWdlcy5jb250ZW50ZnVsLmNvbSUyRmc4cXR2OWd6ZzQ3ZCUyRjV6SGFtb0FMTjZPd21BY2lhRzhPZVklMkY5NjQ5NTMyNDg0NjczZDQyNTFkNGEzZDllNmU3ZDUxYSUyRnNhbmR5LWxpYW5nLWRlc2lnbmVyLTExLmpwZw==?checksum=4a3bbb49b738727182b968174f2d4e7b0009a56d\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Into The Gloss","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4795824517\u0026blog=2457254\u0026group=0\u0026frame=0\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2457254\/4795824517","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/into-gloss-2457254\/sandy-liang-designer-4795824517","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/into-gloss-2457254\/sandy-liang-designer-4795824517","likes":5},"4794609344:2457254":{"post_id":"4794609344","blog_id":"2457254","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/intothegloss\/VUQZ\/~3\/papAxVngWJo\/","content":"You know Coco. (If you don\u0027t, may we direct you to her [The Face interview](https:\/\/intothegloss.com\/2015\/09\/coco-baudelle-model\/) here?) She\u0027s the Canadian lawyer-turned-model-turned-actress who\u0027s been a part of Glossier since we shot our [very first campaign images](https:\/\/glossier.com\/#!\/products\/glossier-phase-1) with her back in 2014. She\u0027s in the Phase 2 campaign that launched yesterday, too, but we figured after all this time, why not see a little of Coco, by Coco herself? When she offered to shoot her own Get Ready With Me video on her iPhone in her East Village apartment, the answer was \u0022Obviously yes, you should do that.\u0022 Because, seriously, this chick is good at everything. Mornings with Coco look like this: Start with one pump of [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/milky-jelly-cleanser)\u2014it\u0027s a comfortable, clean way to start the day (and it wipes away anything you maybe have missed last night). Then load up on [Glossier Priming Moisturizer](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/priming-moisturizer) to hydrate and reduce post-sleep redness. Coco opts for eye cream in the AM\u2014[Kiehl\u0027s Creamy Under-Eye Treatment](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568604469136713) first, then a little [Nourish Grapeseed and Orchid Under Eye Cream](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565570359035229514) to help address puffiness pre-makeup. That comes soon, but first, coffee. In the shower, Coco works [Kumari Luxury Oil Treatment](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568654131241822) through her hair. It\u0027s a mixture of coconut and argan oils that takes care of the scalp while preventing flyaways. The humidity is back in New York folks...say goodbye to static hair and hello to frizz once again. Skin, scalp, and hair has been handled\u2014next comes makeup. Coco switches between [Glossier Stretch Concealer](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/stretch-concealer) in *Dark* and *Medium* depending on how recently she\u0027s been on a tropical vacation. And the reality is, skin color can change based on the season. If you\u0027re in-between shades, we suggest going one step lighter in Stretch Concealer (but matching it to your [Perfecting Skin Tint](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/perfecting-skin-tint) shade is a good rule of thumb). Then in a surprising next step, Coco does her eyebrow routine. She starts with [Marcelle Eyebrow Crayon](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568757638098420) in *Luscious Black* to fill them in and control the shape, then comes [Glossier Boy Brow](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/boy-brow) in *Black*. Over penciled eyebrows, the flexible hold wax brings back that fluffy texture and keeps them from looking too drawn-on. The rest of her face proceeds as such: [Prestige Waterproof Lipliner](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568813482763461) in *Natural* as a nude eyeliner to brighten her lash line, [Revlon Colorstay Eyeshadow](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568861439088118) in *Decadent* for creases, and [L\u0027Or\u00e9al Telescopic Liquid Eyeliner](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568899048989366) in *Carbon Black* for the teeny-tiniest of wings. Then she thickens her lash roots by wiggling [Covergirl Lash Blast Mascara](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565568929627024104) in *Very Black* close to the lid. She finishes up up the face with a sweep of Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint in *Dark* (eight drops on the cheeks, chin, and forehead), with [Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565569964823722499) in *Deep* as her creamy bronzer. Her current favorite blush is [Chanel Joues Contraste Powder Blush](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565570000494385043) in *In Love*. Finishing touches are on the lips: [Glossier Generation G](https:\/\/www.glossier.com\/#!\/products\/generation-g) in *Cake* and [Revlon Colorstay Lipliner](http:\/\/shop-links.co\/1565570083646141916) in *Sienna*.

It\u0027s the only cleanser I use these days as it removes my makeup and cleanses my skin better than any other cleanser I\u0027ve tried. I\u0027ve always been a huge fan of the brand itself, Georgie the founder is a working mum with such a passion for skincare it really shines through. I\u0027ve had the pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and hearing her back story and sharing news of exciting future launches. At a recent event she shared two new products which I\u0027ve been trialling now for about a month. In today\u0027s post I\u0027m going to share with you the details of both products and my experience with them so far. Oskia list all of their ingredients on their website so please check there to see ingredients list.  Renaissance Brightlight - link Brightlight is their new daily correcting serum. The serum is designed to combat hyper-pigmentation, fade dark spots and repair sun damage so it\u0027s definitely aimed at the slightly older market. It evens out skin tone and gives a brighter, illuminated complexion. I checked first to make sure it was ok for me to use, despite not having hyper-pigmentation or dark spots. I won\u0027t be able to tell you the results of that aspect but I do know that this serum has really improved the texture and glow to my skin. It has some AHAs in there which help with the texture so I have been using this morning and night before moisturiser. It\u0027s quite a liquidy serum so a little goes a long way!   Renaissance 360 Moisturiser - link Housed in their new, more compact packaging the Renaissance 360 is Oskia\u0027s new daily moisturiser. It\u0027s a vitamin-rich day cream that combats ageing, improving skin elasticity, reducing fine lines, reducing pigmentation and fading discolouration on the skin. It has an underlying SPF of 8 to protect (Georgie believes in using a separate SPF layered) and this has become a firm favourite of mine. It feels rich enough to hydrate my skin but sinks into the skin really nicely - you only need one pump! Oskia is the brand I always direct people to when they\u0027re lost in the skincare world. It\u0027s a beautiful brand with passion and quality throughout. The new products are out now, the serum is \u00a385 and the moisturiser is \u00a365.","date":"1458198039","title":"OSKIA\u2019S NEW RENNAISANCE PRODUCTS","media":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_0585.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/IMG_0585.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5saWx5cGViYmxlcy5jby51ayUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjAyJTJGSU1HXzA1ODUuanBn?checksum=0ee65ec0295f63300f0e60e8e07e41b3f64c6584\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Lily Pebbles","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4796955552\u0026blog=10800517\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/10800517\/4796955552","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/lily-pebbles-10800517\/oskias-new-rennaisance-products-4796955552","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/lily-pebbles-10800517\/oskias-new-rennaisance-products-4796955552","likes":13},"4796955546:10800517":{"post_id":"4796955546","blog_id":"10800517","link":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/2016\/03\/lancome-juicy-shakers.html","content":"When Lancome took on Lisa Eldridge as their new creative director I think we all knew we\u0027d be in for some big changes and exciting new treats. And so here it is, the first most exciting new launch of the year, the Juicy Shakers. The Lancome Juicy Tube was one of my first ever beauty purchases as a young teenager so this new update really excites me. When I first opened these up to have a look I didn\u0027t really understand what I was looking at as I\u0027ve never really seen anything else like it but I\u0027ve had a couple of weeks to play with them and I\u0027m ready to review! The packaging was inspired by the original Lancome cocktail shaker lipstick and the 90s Juicy Tube that I remember so well. It\u0027s a bi-phase formula that combines pigment with oil so you need to give them a good shake before applying. Although the packaging is insanely cute it\u0027s the applicator that really impressed me. After giving them a good shake you can twist open the lid to reveal a slightly pointed cushion applicator. It\u0027s soft, squishy and very flexible so it feels amazing on the lips. It definitely allows you to apply without a mirror as it really melts the product into the lips. The formula is incredibly sheer which also makes a mirror-free application easy. It leaves a very sheer tint to the lips and because of the sweet almond and cranberry oil in the formula it feels really lovely and comforting on the lips. The only problem with such a sheer finish is that, on my lips, I can hardly tell the difference between the shades. If you also find this then I\u0027d say pick your shade by picking your favourite scent because each Juicy Shaker has a different scent, most of them are fruity. \u0022Meli Melon\u0022 is completely delicious and has me reapplying all day! They are \u00a318 and come in 14 shades, one of which is a clear mint. I\u0027d say it\u0027s worth picking up one but it\u0027s not the kind of thing you\u0027d need multiple of. I\u0027ve really enjoyed using mine just as a day to day stain. My natural lip colour is very pale so it just adds a little colour and shine. I\u0027m really excited to see what else Lancome come up but this is a great start for sure!","date":"1458198020","title":"LANCOME JUICY SHAKERS","media":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lancome-2-1-of-1.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lancome-2-1-of-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5saWx5cGViYmxlcy5jby51ayUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjAzJTJGbGFuY29tZS0yLTEtb2YtMS5qcGc=?checksum=9d070505fbc026c80050ae06b68c63b15cb42d43\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Lily Pebbles","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4796955546\u0026blog=10800517\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/10800517\/4796955546","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/lily-pebbles-10800517\/lancome-juicy-shakers-4796955546","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/lily-pebbles-10800517\/lancome-juicy-shakers-4796955546","likes":14},"4795475344:10800517":{"post_id":"4795475344","blog_id":"10800517","link":"http:\/\/www.lilypebbles.co.uk\/2016\/03\/how-to-take-good-instagram-photos.html","content":"Today\u0027s video is all about my favourite social media platform, Instagram.

I\u0027ve had to keep it a secret for quite a while so it\u0027s really exciting to be able to share the photoshoot and final piece. Blogosphere Magazine got in touch a while back and asked if I\u0027d like to be their next cover girl and I of course jumped at the opportunity. Blogosphere magazine, for those of you who don\u0027t know, is a magazine about blogging, written and edited by bloggers. It\u0027s one of those special, thick, lovely-to-hold magazines that you just want to display on your coffee table to look pretty. It not only looks pretty though, it\u0027s a really interesting read. I spent the day shooting with them and they created the video above which I absolutely love. The entire day was incredibly relaxed, we just sat and chatted and it didn\u0027t feel at all like I was being interviewed. I left with absolutely no idea what I had said so I was incredibly happy with the interview, considering I blabbed on for so long. I feel like Alice, the editor, really captured what I\u0027m all about and how I feel about blogging. She covered so many topics and wrote down my ramblings in such a beautiful way. I\u0027ve re-read the piece so many times, I really do love it. The magazine is available to order online and can be shipped internationally and it would mean the world to me if you got one! If you\u0027re based in the UK it\u0027ll also be stocked in most of the larger WHSmiths from today. Head over to Blogosphere\u0027s Twitter to see a list of shops that will have it.

No\/No  What\u0027s not in it? mineral oil artificial\u00a0colouring parabens sls sles dea  How do you use it?\/Where to use in your routine? \u0027Massage 1-2 pumps of the light-weight oil into dry skin and then add warm water. The oil will melt into a luxurious milky lather that cleanses the skin. Simply rinse off to reveal a clear and nourished complexion.\u0027 I do apply to dry skin but I don\u0027t emulsify. Apply, massage, remove with flannel. What\u2019s good about it? This is a lovely oil, much-needed on the market in term of volume vs price. Admittedly, there are only so many cleansing oils that you can call \u0027innovative\u0027, and while this is not reinventing the wheel, it works, and will appeal to both Elemis customers and fans of oil cleansing. Heavy in omega 9, this is over 90% natural oils and leaves no residue, whether rinsed off or removed with a facecloth. Suitable for first or second cleanse. Also, it\u0027s a whopping 195ml for \u00a329.50. What\u2019s not so good about it? I needed a couple of goes to remove eye makeup, but I do wear very \u0027kohl-y\u0027 types of mascara. If you don\u0027t wear a lot of makeup you should be fine.  How\u0027s the website? Elemis.com is much better than the older timetospa.com, which looks really outdated by comparison.

What\u2019s in it?water (aqua\/eau), cyclopentasiloxane, glycerin, butylene glycol, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, passiflora incarnata seed oil, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, tocopheryl acetate, retinyl palmitate, caprylic\/capric triglyceride, silybum marianum seed oil, tocopherol, porphyra umbilicalis extract, algae extract, commiphora mukul resin extract, rosa multiflora fruit extract, dimethicone\/PEG-10\/15 crosspolymer, sodium chloride, nylon-12, dimethicone\/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, potassium sorbate, fragrance (parfum), guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polysorbate 20, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, sodium citrate, chlorphenesin, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone, limonene, citronellol, blue 1 (CI 42090) Possibly acne\/troubling for some ingredients?fragrancesilicones (although they are crucial to this type of formula) Natural? Organic? Man made? Vegan?man-made Sold in territories that advocate\/require animal testing like China?Yes What\u0027s not in it?mineral oilparabens How do you use it?\/Where to use in your routine?After serums\/before SPF or foundation What\u2019s good about it?This is a really\u00a0lovely\u00a0moisturiser.\u00a0Clearly drawing its inspiration from the Far East \u0027water droplet\u0027 technology, this applies as a light cream\/almost lotion and then upon patting\/gently rubbing the droplets start to appear on the skin, which are then absorbed. The formula does contain marine extracts, which is probably why my skin in particular, enjoys it.Unlike some of its counterparts, the silicones in this formula work with the ingredients, as opposed to what feels almost \u0027independently\u0027 in some formulas. And by that I mean that there is no \u0027rolling\u0027 a couple of minutes after applying. The formula feels more sophisticated, and Bliss seem to be taking their technology a little more seriously these days. Lovely. Works well when making product \u0027sandwiches\u0027 with more expensive products.Check it out. If you can find it. More of which below. What\u2019s not so good about it?With the product? Nothing much. Good, solid cream that does exactly what it says on the box and is not extortionately expensive.Here\u0027s a repeating winge of mine, so much so that I\u0027ve added a new category to the reviews that you\u0027ll see from now on: How\u0027s the website?At first glance the website was great - namely because they have a full ingredients list. Here\u0027s the problem that is costing them money: Bliss Spa launched 20 years ago this year, although it has changed hands a few times since then.Why in the name of INSANITY is the UK website not transactional?\u00a0Blissworld.co.uk is essentially a marketing landing page.\u00a0\u00a0 If you want to actually \u0027buy\u0027 a product, you have to:\u00a0 click \u0027Where to buy\u0027 which takes you to their separate stockists page. You presumably would click on a stockist, then be taken to the product yes?\u00a0 No. Click a stockist of your choice and you are taken to a generic page where every Bliss product is listed in no particular order which means you start searching again.\u00a0 Dutifully search again in the left hand column. It\u0027s out of stock on the first three I tried, including M\u0026S. If you end up on \u0027Time to Spa\u0027, the parent company\u0027s website, it\u0027s not there either. And even better, in the middle of your search, an Elemis offer pops up. Elemis is owned by the same company. But that\u0027s not why I landed on your page. Talk to me in Bliss terms please. Still with me? No? Me neither. Because I would\u0027ve already thought \u0027sod it\u0027 and gone off to make a cup of tea.

Ik ben duidelijk niet de enige fan.  \u201cAls highlighter voor mijn binnenste ooghoeken gebruik ik graag deze oogschaduw van Freedom.\u201d  \u201cIk ga niet het huis uit zonder eyeliner.

De paletten zijn wel goed, maar de losse oogschaduws vind ik teleurstellend. Toch kon ik afgelopen weekend de verleiding niet weerstaan toen ik de gloednieuwe I Love Soft Metals Eyeshadows zag liggen. Die zagen er heel anders uit dan de gewone mono oogschaduws! Ik vond het een goed excuus om het toch weer eens te proberen.    De I Love Soft Metals Eyeshadows zijn sinds deze maand nieuw in het assortiment. De gebakken oogschaduws zijn verkrijgbaar in 9 kleuren en beloven een hele zachte textuur te hebben, met een intens kleureffect en metallic finish. Zacht zijn de poederoogschaduws zeker. Zo zacht zelfs, dat ik tijdens het swatchen een deuk in een van de oogschaduw maakte omdat ik blijkbaar iets teveel kracht zette. Oeps\u2026 Essence I Love Soft Metals Eyeshadow \u20ac 2,59   08 Honeybee \u2013 09 Lavender Touch \u2013 03 Melted Kiss \u2013 07 Vintage Green Echt veel kleur geven de oogschaduws niet af, wel zijn ze alle vier prachtig glanzend. Hoe zal dat uitpakken in de ooglook, als \u00e9\u00e9n glanzende waas? Of zal ik toch wel degelijk kleurverschillen zien?   Producten gebruikt: MAC Prep + Prime Eye Base 09 Lavender Touch (wenkbrauwbot en binnenste ooghoek) 08 Honeybee (eerste deel bewegend ooglid) 03 Melted Kiss (tweede deel bewegend ooglid) 07 Vintage Green (ardaceboog) Miss Sporty The Miaoww Eyeliner \u2013 review Smashbox Full Exposure Waterproof Mascara   Kiko Modern Tribes Free Spirit Lippotlood 01 Hearty Peach \u2013 review Het effect van de oogschaduws blijft zacht en glanzend, maar het is zeker niet zo dat ik geen enkele kleur meer kan herkennen. Alle vier de oogschaduws zijn duidelijk zichtbaar in de ooglook. Het aanbrengen voelde wat gek vanwege de aparte zachte textuur van de oogschaduws, maar ging net als het blenden, over het algemeen prima. Ik hoefde helemaal niet veel moeite te doen voor het maken van de ooglook, de oogschaduws werkten goed mee.  Ook als je net als ik geen fan bent van de mono oogschaduws van Essence, zijn de I Love Soft Metals Eyeshadows het proberen waard. Ik vind dat ze een prachtig effect geven en ik denk ook zeker dat ze in combinatie met andere matte oogschaduws, heel mooi zullen zijn. Wat ik wel een nadeel vind is dat de oogschaduws met basis (ik gebruikte Urban Decay Primer Potion) aan het einde van de dag toch wat in de lijnen van mijn ogen zijn getrokken. Ze blijven dus niet de hele dag mooi zitten. Mijn persoonlijke favorieten zijn 08 Honeybee, wat ik een schitterende highlighter vind en 03 Melted Kiss, een prachtige koperkleur. Essence is te koop bij Kruidvat en Trekpleister.","date":"1458104400","title":"Essence I Love Soft Metals Eyeshadow","media":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/essence_I_love_soft_metals_eyeshadow01.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/essence_I_love_soft_metals_eyeshadow01.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnZlcmFjYW1pbGxhLm5sJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkZlc3NlbmNlX0lfbG92ZV9zb2Z0X21ldGFsc19leWVzaGFkb3cwMS5qcGc=?checksum=1ed5fdfdce5d55ba11bc5769bd32978ef93d9a00\u0026format=h"}},"name":"veracamilla.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4795379856\u0026blog=1129512\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1129512\/4795379856","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/essence-i-love-soft-metals-eyeshadow-4795379856","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/essence-i-love-soft-metals-eyeshadow-4795379856","likes":13},"4793899735:1129512":{"post_id":"4793899735","blog_id":"1129512","link":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/2016\/03\/smashbox-shapematters-palette-brow-face-eye\/","content":"Smashbox heeft een pracht van een palette ontworpen, #shapematters voor wenkbrauwen, gezicht en ogen. Het is nogal een flink palette: groot en best zwaar. Volgens Smashbox zit in dit palette alles om je camera ready te maken. Wenkbrauwpoeders, contouringpoeders en oogschaduws. Volle wenkbrauwen, een intense oogopslag en vlijmscherpe jukbeenderen. Are you ready for your close-up?    Zoals ik in de inleiding ook al vertelde, is het palette groot en vrij zwaar. Heel geschikt voor reizen vind ik hem niet. Het is wel echt een heel mooi palette, gemaakt van stevig materiaal en met een grote spiegel aan de binnenkant. Het #shapematters palette gooi je misschien niet in je tas voor vakantie, maar zet je wel mooi neer op je kaptafel. Smashbox #shapematters palette \u20ac \u20ac 64,50   Waar alles voor bedoeld is, staat heel duidelijk aangegeven op het plastic beschermfolie wat over de poeders heen ligt. Ook zitten er drie kaartjes bij het palette met instructies. Met deze kaartjes kun je ook tutorials kijken door naar de Smashbox website te gaan, en een kaartje op het beeldscherm van je telefoon te leggen. Dat heb ik een aantal keren en op verschillende manieren geprobeerd, maar ik kreeg het niet voor elkaar. Ik vind het heel leuk bedacht, maar misschien was een eenvoudige link toch een beter idee geweest. Had die in ieder geval ook op de kaartjes gezet, want nu heb ik de tutorials niet kunnen bekijken en dat vind ik jammer.  Links: wax en twee kleuren wenkbrauwpoeder Midden: contouring, bronzer en highlighter Rechts: oogschaduw  In het #shapematters palette zit een dubbelzijdige kwast. Het linker uiteinde is schuin afgesneden, bedoeld voor de wenkbrauwen. Het rechteruiteinde is een luchtige oogschaduwkwast.   Het is me niet duidelijk wat voor haren er voor de kwast zijn gebruikt, maar echt zacht zijn ze niet. De kant voor oogschaduw is prima als ik niks anders voor handen heb, maar het kwastje voor de wenkbrauwen vond ik echt niet fijn. Te dik en niet stevig genoeg. Ik kreeg mijn wenkbrauwen er niet mooi en precies mee ingekleurd. Brows   De wax uit het palette heb ik niet geswatcht, die is kleurloos. De wenkbrauwpoeders wel, ze zijn vrij licht en warm van kleur. Vooral de donkerste tint oogt wat oranje. De pigmentatie is overigens prima.  Ik kreeg het niet voor elkaar om met de wenkbrauwpoeders en de kwast uit het palette, mijn wenkbrauwen mooi in te kleuren. Ik heb het eerst geprobeerd met de lichte tint, maar die viel op mijn toch al blonde wenkbrauwharen, compleet weg. De donkere tint is wel goed zichtbaar, maar de kleur is te warm en vind ik niet mooi staan. Een koelere tint had een natuurlijker effect gegeven. Ook de wax bleek lastig in gebruik. Erg vettig, niet makkelijk uit te smeren en leek soms wat witte stukje achter te laten. Na het gebruik van de poeders, wax en het wenkbrauwkwastje, ziet het resultaat er rommelig en oranje uit. Als alternatief zou je de wenkbrauwpoeders wel als oogschaduws kunnen gebruiken, zo blijven ze niet onaangeroerd in het palette achter en het zijn prima tinten voor een ooglook. Face  Contour \u2013 Bronze Highlight \u2013 Glow  In het palette zit een contouring poeder, een matte bronzer en een matte en glanzende highlighter. De pigmentatie is goed, daar heb ik niets aan op te merken. En de glans in Glow vind ik erg mooi, die springt er bij de swatches meteen uit.  Ik heb de poeders in stappen aangebracht.  Foto 2: Contour langs mijn neus en onder mijn jukbeenderen Foto 3: Bronze op mijn jukbeenderen Foto 4: de matte Highlight op de brug van mijn neus Foto 5: Glow op het hoogste punt van mijn jukbeenderen  Close-up van Contour, Bronze en Glow Ik vind dat de poeders zeker een heel camera ready effect geven. Ze passen prachtig bij elkaar, brengen makkelijk aan en blenden natuurlijk in. Soms is het effect subtiel (Highlight) en soms juist heel duidelijk (Glow). Ja, camera ready is het effect zeker, maar in het echt vond ik het wel wat minder mooi. Het resultaat zag er in daglicht grauw uit, vanwege de koele taupekleur van Contour. Op beeld prachtig, maar voor het dagelijks leven gebruik ik liever wat minder Contour en wat meer Bronze. Dat staat bij mij een stuk gezonder. Eyes  In het palette zitten 9 tinten oogschaduw. Licht en donker, mat en glanzend, naturel en met iets meer kleur. Het zijn vrij diverse tinten, hoewel er geen echte knalkleuren in zitten.  1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3  4 \u2013 5 \u2013 6  7 \u2013 8 \u2013 9 De pigmentatie van de oogschaduws is goed, ze zijn eigenlijk allemaal wel intens. De glanzende oogschaduws hebben een hele fijne en zachte textuur, de matte oogschaduws uit de laatste rij voelen wat stroever aan.   Producten gebruikt: MAC Prep + Prime Eye Base 3 (wenkbrauwbot en binnenste ooghoek) 5 (eerste deel bewegend ooglid) 6 (tweede deel bewegend ooglid) 4 (geblend in arcadeboog) 8 (ardaceboog) Miss Sporty The Miaoww Eyeliner \u2013 review Essence Forbidden Volume Mascara Wat een fijne en mooie oogschaduws! Ze passen mooi bij elkaar en de goede pigmentatie van de swatches is ook duidelijk te zien in de ooglook. Je kunt voor heel neutraal gaan, maar ook iets meer kleur aanbrengen. Een compleet matte ooglook maken, maar ook voor een glinsterende oogopslag zorgen.   Essence XXXL Longlasting Lipgloss MATT Effect 05 Velvet Rose \u2013 review Ooglook en gezichtscontour gedaan met het palette Wenkbrauwen ingekleurd met de Catrice Eyebrow Set.  Met zo\u2019n groot palette is het haast onmogelijk alles \u2018goed\u2019 te doen. De kans dat de wenkbrauwpoeders, of juiste contouring tinten niet bij jouw huid- of haarkleur passen, is best groot. Met een palette als dit, moet je eigenijk altijd wel wat water bij de wijn doen. Zo vind ik de oogschaduws prachtig, net als de poeders voor mijn gezicht, maar gebruik ik de warmgekleurde wenkbrauwpoeders niet (hoewel ik ze gelukkig ook prima als oogschaduws kan inzetten). De kwaliteit vind ik over het algemeen heel goed. Het Smashbox #shapematters palette is mooi en compleet. En voor wat er allemaal in zit, vind ik de prijs ook heel schappelijk. Helaas zal dit palette waarschijnlijk nooit op alle punten goed scoren, dus probeer hem in de winkel uit en bekijk zelf hoe hij bij je past en wat jij het belangrijkste in het palette vindt. Smashbox is te koop bij Douglas en hier online te bestellen.","date":"1458018000","title":"Smashbox #shapematters palette | Brow, Face \u0026 Eye","media":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/smashbox_shapematters_palette01.jpg","media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/smashbox_shapematters_palette01.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnZlcmFjYW1pbGxhLm5sJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkZzbWFzaGJveF9zaGFwZW1hdHRlcnNfcGFsZXR0ZTAxLmpwZw==?checksum=9a09805b2b06d620ccee72745513cc8db6c18fa3\u0026format=h"}},"name":"veracamilla.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4793899735\u0026blog=1129512\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=a","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1129512\/4793899735","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/smashbox-shapematters-palette-brow-face-eye-4793899735","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/smashbox-shapematters-palette-brow-face-eye-4793899735","likes":12},"4797470482:2617087":{"post_id":"4797470482","blog_id":"2617087","link":"http:\/\/feeds.feedblitz.com\/~\/144548040\/0\/britishbeautyblogger~Uniqlo-Scandinavian-Scarves\/","content":"For anyone who has baulked at the price of Becksondergaard scarves, this Scandinavian collaboration with Uniqlo might hit the spot.

I\u2019ve been picking out my warmer beauty favourites in prep\u2026 I always dig out the salt spray for the sunny seasons, and my go-to right now has to be the Drybar Mai Tai Spritzer \u2013 a super light, ultra-texturising spray that adds so much life to my hair. It\u2019s such a fuss-free way to guarantee shiny, wavy locks everyday. I\u2019ll also be wearing the new Chloe Love Story EDT on the regular, as it\u2019s such a dreamy combination that works perfectly in warmer weather. It\u2019s light but lingers, and has a warmth that I can\u2019t resist. Heavenly! As for body, this Lush combo of Rough With The Smooth body scrub and Karma Kream body lotion has seen to any dry patches I may have. I cannot recommend this duo enough if you\u2019re prone to patchy, rough limbs \u2013 it really does tackle any problem areas with minimal effort. After all, surely it\u2019ll be bare leg weather soon?! I\u2019ve taken to starting my day with a light helping of the REN Micro Polish Cleanser; I\u2019ve been through tubes and tubes of this stuff and I can\u2019t fault its skin-smoothing ways. It\u2019s abrasive enough to feel effective, but not irritating at all. It\u2019s one of my all time favourite skincare finds. I\u2019m also really loving the Aesop Parsley Seed Anti-oxidant Hydrator, a hydrating daily moisturiser packed with goodness. I use a lot of Aesop products as I find they work wonders with my skin. Plus, the velvety finish is a game-changer for warm weather! My makeup always brightens and lightens up come spring \u2013 I\u2019m all about bright cheeks and dewy skin! I\u2019m in love with the Charlotte Tilbury Colour of Youth blush \u2013 I wish she would make this a permanent product as its SO pretty. It melts in to skin for the most enviable flush. I\u2019m forever insisting everyone buy the Filmstar Bronze \u0026 Glow palette, but it really is a must have product. Charlotte knows highlighters! I\u2019m also opting for the Maestro Glow foundation, and the NARS Alhambra Eyeshadow Duo \u2013 two products that I\u2019ve been seriously impressed with lately! I wear both of these almost daily as they\u2019re so effortless! What are you reaching for in Spring?

It\u2019s just so different from my usual everyday staples, so I always look forward to the packing process! I spent about three weeks searching for the right bikini, as I, like most, have one of those shapes where the top of me isn\u2019t anywhere near the same size as the bottom half! Saying that, I ended up trying on this Boohoo bikini, and I was so impressed with how flattering it is. It\u2019s not too booby for someone with a rather large chest, and the bottoms are pretty slimming too. If only I could find more of this shape\u2026 I also picked up these cute ASOS striped shorts in my holiday hunt, and I fell in love instantly. I just love anything with a cute tassel, and the simple grey and white strips are so effortless. I found this New Look top to go with them, a simple design that can be pretty much worn with anything. The sunglasses are both Ray-Bans, and they seem to be the kind of style to suit just about every face shape. Seen at the top are the Ray-Ban 3447 Round Sunglasses, a style I\u2019ve seen everywhere lately \u2013 even an old man in town was rocking them the other day! The bottom pair are the Ray-Ban 2180 sunglasses, which I absolutely love as a simple everyday style! Along with my favourite Topshop headscarf, and these cute and comfy New Look sandals, I\u2019m pretty much set! As for beauty, I always pack the Clinique Even Better Dark Spot Defence as my everyday face SPF \u2013 this has a bit of a tint so it\u2019s super perfecting, and not too greasy. I also took the Chantecaille Just Skin Tinted Moisturiser; it\u2019s not often I wear makeup on holiday, but this is just so light and easy to apply that I packed it just in case. I also have the TIGI Beach Bound spray to protect my hair, which has been working wonders \u2013 no more crispy, dry locks! Finally, my trusty Canon EOS M10 came along with me! I\u2019m totally obsessing over this camera right now, I\u2019m getting some awesome snaps from the trip. Are you a good holiday packer?

I\u2019m currently writing this next to the warm, turquoise waters while sipping an iced coffee. Sorry \u2019bout it. 01. We arrived in beautiful Antigua in the Caribbean this week, and it\u2019s been LOVELY to finally see the sun! This is my first time in the Caribbean and I\u2019m already hooked on the island life \u2013 everyone is SO chill and the locals are the friendliest people ever. We\u2019re hoping to explore quite a lot of the island, so expect to see all of the blue\/green hues over on Instagram. 02. I watched The Intern on the flight here, and it has to be one of the best films I\u2019ve seen in a while! I think I was on a continuous cry\/laugh cycle throughout the whole film, but Robert DeNiro plays the most adorable old man \u2013 I really cannot help but love a vulnerable wee old man, breaks my heart. Anne Hathaway kills it as the ultimate girlboss too! 03. I bought my Kindle with me for some sunny reading, but I\u2019m totally at a loss for what to read! I haven\u2019t read anything good in a while, but we have a hammock so something has to be done about the book situation. I like psychological thrillers, but nothing too young or farfetched (lol)\u2026 can anyone recommend anything? 04. My plan for this week is to explore a little; we\u2019re on the boat again with my parents so I think we will perhaps sail to some of the other islands too. We have a kayak, snorkelling gear and inflatable rings so I can guarantee that a lot of my time will be spent in the water! Beats a session with my PT, that\u2019s for sure\u2026 05. My holiday wardrobe is on point, so I\u2019m going to try and rope in my loved ones to take a few outfit snaps for me. We\u2019ll see how we get on! Relationships may be ruined, bridges burned\u2026 but as long as my Instagram feed is on fire, eh. Sometimes when I see my warm weather outfits compared to what I wear at home in Scotland, I feel like I should be living in a hot country. Very reflective, Kate. How is everyone this week?

Old habits die hard. My little room has been an ongoing project for what feels like forever. It\u0027s where I spend a huge portion of my time - for relaxing, sleeping and working - so having a space I can be happy and motivated in is so important. For a long time I\u0027ve felt suffocated and a bit hopeless, not knowing how I\u0027ll be able to make it better. It does seem a bit pointless completing it so close to a time I\u0027ll be looking to move out, but I\u0027ve never really been one to fight an urge.. I\u0027ll get around to showing my \u0027office space\u0027 when I get the chance, but for now everything I own is trusty IKEA. No surprises there! I\u0027ve changed a few bits around, replaced my huge bookcase with a smaller one and got another set of ALEX drawers (on wheels this time.. exciting!) for under my desk. The joy of storage indeed. I\u0027m still loving the thought of a ladder shelf. I don\u0027t have any room for one, so the idea is reserved for when I have my own place; for now I\u0027ll have to stick to Pinterest and an over-active imagination. A while back I tweeted about this little brass armadillo from West Elm. Nope, not stopped thinking about it. What purpose he\u0027d serve, I don\u0027t know.. but he sure would be nice to look at! I spotted these little alphabet mugs in M\u0026S before Christmas and have made a mental note to buy a couple. A good light is still on my list too - look at this little beauty from Heal\u0027s! Pls give. I used to be all over patterned bedding (if you have any recommendations for good quality bedding that doesn\u0027t cost the Earth, pop them down below!), but more recently I\u0027m really into the idea of plain sheets with accents of colour thrown on top. I bought this boucl\u00e9 effect weave blanket from Zara Home a few months ago and I love it - super soft and a great mix of colours. They\u0027ve since increased the price. Swines! The leaf print and pom-pom cushios are both H\u0026M and I\u0027m clicking back to see if they\u0027re in stock more than I care to admit at the moment. I did have my eye on some similar leaf print covers on Etsy, but the potentially extortionate customs charges are holding me back for now. We\u0027ll see! Finishing touches will be a cute chair - not even sorry that I\u0027m planning on joining the Eames bandwagon here - and extra small storage (these are great for tech and stuff that just needs a place to live).. and another candle won\u0027t hurt. Which home bits are you loving at the moment?","date":"1456171200","title":"Just Thinking About Interiors..

Christmas is just around the corner and I have what feels like a million things to organise. Sure recently posed me the challenge of putting their Invisible Black + White antiperspirant (\u00a33.19) to the test during a busy day. Promising 48 hours of protection with the added guarantee of no white marks on black clothes, nor any pesky yellow stains on white clothes, it\u0027s perfect timing for the LBD party season! Another plus is the Compressed 125ml size (which lasts just as long as the big 250ml can) fits into your clutch, and generally cuts back on daytime supplies.. if you\u0027re like me and are prone to bringing everything but the kitchen sink with you. Considering most of my wardrobe is black or white, Sure Invisible Black + White fits perfectly into my routine. I tend to steer clear of antiperspirant sprays in general because of the whole white marks dilemma, so I was excited to see the results! I thought I\u0027d use the day as an opportunity to get through all the weirdly stressful tasks I\u0027ve been putting off for a while: buying a pair of black jeans, finding a secret Santa gift for a friend, spending some gift cards before they expired.. all between meetings and having to stay fresh for date night. Not easy for a complete worrier like myself! A brand new outfit - everything is from ASOS, links below - definitely helps me to feel great, but it was down to Sure Invisible Black + White to keep me feeling fresh and confident throughout the day. Jumping on and off the tube while bundled up in a coat and scarf is enough to break anyone out in a sweat, so I was pleasantly surprised to feel so comfortable! I even managed to keep my cool through the best part of an hour trying on different lengths and styles of skinny jeans which has basically never happened to me before. Never mind that I could have saved all of that time just buying another pair of Topshop Jamies.. The day absolutely flew by - I may have needed to powder before meeting my boyfriend for dinner, but otherwise felt shower-fresh! Top marks.. or should that be no marks? I\u0027m a convert for sure. I\u0027ll stop now. If only coffee was as reliable!   SHOP THE POST  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. This post is sponsored by Sure.

Whenever this time of year rolls around, I get a sense of dread that I can\u0027t shake. It could be past experiences that resurface on an annual basis - my life just seems to turn upside down riiight around the time of my birthday, without fail - and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because I\u0027m looking for things to go wrong since it\u0027s what I\u0027m used to, or if I\u0027m just straight-up cursed with some rotten luck. It\u0027s like my own personal Mercury retrograde (non-believers; it\u0027s totally a thing). I\u0027ve been in a duvet cocoon feeling completely sorry for myself all day. Ignoring three huge boxes I ordered accidentally-on-purpose from ASOS (wine and the internet are a dangerous mix) because pyjamas seemed like a better option. People say it\u0027s best to keep busy when you feel weird that\u0027s never really been what I\u0027m about. I\u0027m a wallower. It\u0027s just as well I never wanted to be a life coach. I\u0027m not even sure how I\u0027m supposed to make any sense out of this word vomit, so I have no idea how it\u0027s going to sound outside of my head either. I guess I\u0027d have to put it like this; when you feel like you\u0027re on autopilot for a long time.. it\u0027s hard to get back in the seat. Cryptic. Wonderful. Okay, I\u0027m going back to bed.
