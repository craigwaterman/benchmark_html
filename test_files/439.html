<p>Global sales of PCs fell 14% in the first three months of the year, the biggest fall since research firm IDC started tracking the industry in 1994.</p>
<p>IDC said 76.3 million units were shipped, a figure that underlines the appeal of tablets and smartphones as alternatives to PCs.</p>
<p>The firm said Microsoft&#8217;s latest version of Windows had failed to revitalise the industry.</p>
<p>Recession had also led companies to put back renewal of their PCs, IDC said.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s vice president, Bob O&#8217;Donnell, said: &#8220;Unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only didn&#8217;t provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Windows 8 is designed to work well with touch-sensitive screens, but the displays add to the cost of a PC. Together, the changes and higher prices &#8220;have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices,&#8221; Mr O&#8217;Donnell said.</p>
<p>Microsoft was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>IDC also said that, traditionally, companies replaced PCs every three years, but that during the economic downturn this was more likely to be every five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is horrific news for PCs,&#8221; said BGC financial analyst Colin Gillis. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about mobile computing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, the world&#8217;s largest maker of PCs, saw a 24% fall in shipments in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Lenovo Group, number two in the market, is benefiting from sales to first-time buyers in China and other developing countries. Its sales held steady, IDC said.</p>

						<p><strong>The digital currency spikes at $266 before plunging to $105 on Wednesday in wild ride possibly linked to Reddit user</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" itemprop="contentUrl representativeOfPage" alt="A Bitcoin" src="//static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/10/1365626631271/A-Bitcoin-010.jpg" width="371" height="222" /></p>
<p itemprop="caption" style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>One Bitcoin. One financial expert compared the interest in Bitcoin to the tulip mania that gripped the Dutch in the 17th century.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Bitcoin" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a></strong>, the digital currency, lost more than $160 (£104) in value on Wednesday, just hours after hitting a record high.</p>
<p>The currency hit a new high of $266 before falling to $105 and then bouncing back to $130. The fall is unlikely to put off speculators. Two months ago, a Bitcoin was worth $20.</p>
<p>With Europe racked by economic uncertainty following the banking crisis in Cyprus, there have been fears that a &#8220;bubble&#8221; is being created with speculators piling into the four-year-old digital currency. But Bitcoin has crashed before only to bounce back. It hit a low of $7 in August 2011 after hitting a high of $32 two months earlier.</p>
<p>Jon Matonis of the Bitcoin Foundation, the currency&#8217;s promoter, denied a euro-bubble was being created in an interview with Der Spiegel this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most transactions are still coming from affluent regions, like the United States and northern Europe. What we are seeing is not a Cyprus bubble,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Until recently Bitcoin had been a <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/07/bitcoin-scares-banks-governments" target="_blank">largely obscure currency used by the tech-savvy</a></strong>, libertarians wishing to thumb their noses at central bankers and people involved in more nefarious activities such as online gambling (often illegal in the US)<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace" target="_blank"> <strong>or drug deals</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There are around 11m Bitcoins in circulation, 25 new bitcoins are produced every 10 minutes, and they are traded through <strong><a href="https://mtgox.com/" target="_blank">online exchanges like Mt.Gox</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Dealing in the currency is volatile as has been the history of the services that allow people to trade in Bitcoins. Mt.Gox has been subject to repeated hacking attacks. Instawallet, a popular service for storing Bitcoins, had to be suspended after it was hacked.</p>
<p>Many financial experts have warned against Bitcoin. Veteran UBS stockbroker Art Cashin has <strong><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/art-cashin-the-bitcoin-bubble-2013-4" target="_blank">compared the interest in Bitcoin to the tulip</a></strong>mania that led many to financial ruin in the 17th century. But interest in the currency has shot up as the euro has become ever more embattled. The value of a Bitcoin passed the $200 mark for the first time on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s wild ride came as someone gave away thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins on Reddit, the social news site. News blog Business Insider calculated a Reddit user under the name<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bitcoinbillionaire-2013-4" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;Bitcoinbillionaire&#8221; had given away $13,627.69896</strong> </a>worth of Bitcoins to Reddit users over the day. The mystery donor signed off with a quote from Ron Paul, libertarian politician and one-time would-be presidential candidate: &#8220;It&#8217;s no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.&#8221;</p>
<p itemprop="name headline  "><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/10/bitcoin-new-high-losing-160" target="_blank"><strong>Bitcoin hits new high before losing $160 in value in one day</strong></a></p>

						<p><strong>A police force wasted millions of pounds of public money developing a new &#8220;criminal intelligence&#8221; computer system that will never be used, it was revealed today.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="//i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02532/Bob-Quick_2532484b.jpg" width="430" height="268" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Ideas to develop a one-off computer system for Surrey was supported by the then Chief Constable Bob Quick</strong></em></p>
<p>Surrey Police spent years working with a private IT firm to create a bespoke, high-tech network which would be used to store criminal records and log crimes so commanders could map trends of offences across the county.</p>
<p>However, the force&#8217;s new police commissioner pulled the plug on the doomed multi-million pound project this week after deciding it was &#8220;not in best interests of both Surrey Police and the Surrey public&#8221; to carry on with the scheme which began six years ago.</p>
<p>The costly blunder comes just months after Surrey Police admitted wasting tens of thousands of pounds on an axed contract to outsource back office jobs to scandal-hit security firm G4S.</p>
<p>An independent investigation was underway today into what had gone wrong with the force&#8217;s new IT scheme, which was codenamed Project Siren by Surrey&#8217;s commanding officers.</p>
<p>Ideas to develop a one-off computer system for Surrey&#8217;s officers was first mooted back in 2005, and was strongly supported by the then Chief Constable Bob Quick.</p>
<p>It was also backed and signed off at the time by the Surrey Police Authority, which was replaced by an elected Police Crime Commissioner (PCC) last November.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of pounds was said to have been spent on IT consultants to outline a high-tech vision for a new system that brought all of the force&#8217;s computer records into one software program.</p>
<p>In 2009, the new Chief Constable, Mark Rowley, and the local police authority agreed on a confidential contract with IT giant Memex SAS to develop Project Siren.</p>
<p>However, sources confirmed that, after blowing millions of pounds on the multi-million pound project, senior commanders realised the system would not be able to be integrated with other forces around the country.</p>
<p>The technical burden of developing a new piece of software from scratch also proved too much for the force&#8217;s constrained budget when the project began heamorraging public money, insiders said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, neighbouring forces had invested in new &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; IT programs that proved to be cheaper and actually worked.</p>
<p>Surrey Police&#8217;s current Chief Constable Lynne Owens decided enough was enough after she inherited the mess in February last year.</p>
<p>Last November, she asked the force&#8217;s new Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Kevin Hurley to swing the axe &#8211; and he finally consigned Project Siren to the rubbish bin earlier this week after ordering out his own probe into the fiasco.</p>
<p>A source close to the Commissioner confirmed the amount of money spent on the force&#8217;s IT scheme had &#8220;ran into millions of pounds&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s Police and Crime Panel and independent auditors Grant Thornton have now launched separate inquiries to investigate exactly how much money was wasted on the IT project and get to the bottom of what went wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;My decision to withdraw from the Siren project has not been taken lightly, but I believe that this course of action will ultimately be in the best interests of both Surrey Police and the Surrey public,&#8221; commissioner Hurley said in a statement today.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I hope you can appreciate that a full inquiry into a project of this scale is likely to take some time and that it would not be proper for me to comment further at this stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disatrous end to the six-year project comes just months after Surrey Police lost tens of thousands of pounds in consultancy fees after it cancelled a joint £1.5bn contract it was about to sign with security company G4S.</p>
<p>The deal for the firm to provide back office support staff to Surrey and West Midlands Police was pulled in the wake of the company&#8217;s role in the Olympic security fiasco &#8211; resulting in a loss of £160,000 pounds to Surrey&#8217;s taxpayers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is yet another big mess Surrey Police have got themselves into,&#8221; commented Nick O&#8217;Shea, who ran as Surrey&#8217;s Liberal Democrat candidate in the recent PCC elections.</p>
<p>Speaking today, he added: &#8220;A lot of money and time has been wasted on Project Siren, which frankly was a waste of time from the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;My perception was that it was not fit for purpose and that if you try and make a bespoke IT system like this, it&#8217;s going to cost a fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should have been working with other organisations whether in industry or other police forces to get a fit-for-purpose system. Otherwise, you&#8217;d end up with 42 different systems across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Surrey County Councillor added: &#8220;It seems a dreadful waste of money. Surrey Police Authority was guilty of trying to reinvent the wheel, instead of working with other police forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blame has to lie with the former Chief Constables and the police authority at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Project Siren was said to be the &#8220;baby&#8221; of Surrey&#8217;s former Chief Constable Bob Quick, who hit headlines after he left the force in 2008 to become Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations at London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police Service.</p>
<p>Quick&#8217;s reputation took a hammering in 2009, stemming first from the controversial arrest of Tory frontbencher Damian Green.</p>
<p>The final straw, which led to his resignation from the Met, came when terror raids in the North West had to be brought forward because he was caught on camera exposing sensitive documents as he arrived for a meeting in Downing Street.</p>
<p>He could not be reached for comment about the Project Siren fiasco today/yesterday (Weds).</p>
<p>Reacting to the cancellation of Project Siren, Surrey&#8217;s current Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm said: &#8220;We welcome the decision by the Police and Crime Commissioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The management of information is critical in delivering effective policing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given operational collaboration with other forces in the region, and as the national policing environment has now changed, we must also adapt our plans or risk losing out on the wider benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current crime management system remains operational and the decision to withdraw from the Siren project will not impact on day-to-day policing which continues as normal.&#8221;</p>

						<p><strong>Fears of civil disorder in capital as plans are revealed for partially state-funded ceremonial funeral. Meanwhile lawyers warn against pre-emptive arrests as police scan social media to identify likely protesters</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="//www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article8566462.ece/ALTERNATES/w460/web-thatcher-rust-ap.jpg" width="460" height="339" /></p>
<p>Police officers are monitoring social media, internet forums and BlackBerry messaging networks in the expectation that Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s funeral procession next Wednesday will be targeted by protesters.</p>
<p>The possibility of demonstrations during the funeral has raised concerns that police may adopt the controversial tactic of making pre-emptive arrests.</p>
<p>Plans appear to be under way for different groups to demonstrate during the funeral, and to hold celebrations around the country on the same day.</p>
<p>Police concerns have been fuelled by the impromptu street parties which broke out on Monday evening in Leeds, Bristol, Brixton, Liverpool and Glasgow – some of which resulted in arrests after clashes with officers.</p>
<p>Police and security-service planning for Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s funeral has been under way for three and a half years. Officers will probably be required to line the route from the Houses of Parliament to St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral to make sure that the cortège is not stopped.</p>
<p>The protests present a logistical headache for the Metropolitan Police, whose officers will have to make sure the procession is not disrupted while respecting the public&#8217;s right to voice an opinion on one of Britain&#8217;s most divisive politicians.</p>
<p>A Met spokesman said: &#8220;London&#8217;s police, the MPS, City of London and British Transport Police are working together to deliver a security operation for Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s funeral. Given the nature of the event, our operation will use of a range of appropriate tactics.&#8221; The Met&#8217;s first large-scale challenge is likely to be handling anti-Thatcher protests this Saturday evening in Trafalgar Square – a part of London associated with the moment the former Prime Minister&#8217;s power began to crumble as poll tax protests turned violent.</p>
<p>The Met has made &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; arrests in recent years after gathering intelligence about high-profile demonstrations – most notably before the Royal Wedding in 2011. Scores of people were detained in its run-up.</p>
<p>Some of those arrested took their case to the High Court which ruled that, on the facts of the individual cases, the arrests were lawful. An appeal is set to take place this summer. At the time of the original case one of the arguments police used to justify the arrests was that they aimed to protect minority protesters from angry crowds.</p>
<p>Daniel, a 26-year-old from south London who was at Monday night&#8217;s Brixton protest and is helping to organise something similar for Saturday evening, told The Independent: &#8220;There&#8217;s never been an event with such a publicity run-up. At Brixton, the samba band and a sound system just turned up. Something similar will happen on Saturday. People will come and there&#8217;ll be a few portable sound systems there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believed protests would only turn violent if the police tried to stop people voicing their opinion. &#8220;It would be unwise of the police to come down hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even a heavy police presence will provoke a reaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation that allows for pre-emptive arrests is narrow and human rights lawyers have warned against any pre-funeral sweeps.</p>
<p>Michael Oswald, from Bhatt Murphy solicitors, which represented 15 people who were arrested during the Royal Wedding, said: &#8220;There must be a concern that the events that took place in Bristol and Brixton will be used by the police to justify the kind of tactics that were seen in the run-up to and during the Royal Wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever one thinks about the rights and wrongs of protesting during a funeral, the law protects people&#8217;s freedom to voice their opinions publicly in a peaceful manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Politicians from across the political spectrum urged members of the public who disliked Lady Thatcher or her politics to show restraint. Tony Blair said: &#8220;Even if you disagree with someone very strongly – particularly at the moment of their passing – you should show some respect.&#8221; When asked if he was worried there would be similar celebrations when he dies, he said: &#8220;When you decide, you divide. I think she would be pretty philosophical about it and I hope I will be too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tory MP Conor Burns, a regular visitor of Lady Thatcher, said she would have been pleased by the reaction. &#8220;Funnily enough the parties that we&#8217;re seeing, the things in some of these mining communities and those young people opening the champagne in Glasgow – they&#8217;re a remarkable tribute to her,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember telling her about the TUC Congress selling the Thatcher &#8216;death party packs&#8217;. She said the fact that they felt so strongly about her more than 20 years after she left Downing Street was a tribute to the fact she had done something in politics rather than simply been someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland&#8217;s Deputy First Minister, said people should &#8220;resist celebrating&#8221;, adding: &#8220;She was not a peacemaker but it is a mistake to allow her death to poison our minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former miners in Easington, Co Durham, will mark the 20 years since their pit closed with a party on the day of her funeral. Alan Cummings, chairman of the Durham Miners&#8217; Association, said the timing of the events was &#8220;remarkable&#8221; and &#8220;one of those quirks&#8221;, adding: &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t be cremated on a better day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We are inviting ex-miners and their families to go back over their memories of the strike and what has happened since the closure of the pit. I couldn&#8217;t stand her. She had a very patronising manner and I could have put my foot through the television whenever I saw her on there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We opposed and hated everything she did. She has wrecked thousands and thousands of lives so, no, it&#8217;s not in poor taste. We can understand why people are happy and rejoicing that she has gone because they remember these communities have never recovered.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Calls made for Trafalgar Square statue</strong></p>
<p>Calls for a statue of Lady Thatcher to be erected on the empty fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square were criticised by Falklands veteran Simon Weston, who warned it could become a target for protests.</p>
<p>Commander John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander on the SS Canberra during the Falklands War, said there should be a permanent public memorial, and that it should be next to Nelson &#8220;to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Lord Tebbit also said they were in favour. Mr Weston said a statue would be &#8220;fitting&#8221; but he warned of the &#8220;reaction of the foolhardy&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Who loves their fibre broadband? Now you know who to thank</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obituary:</strong> Baroness Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister who worked alongside the world&#8217;s first business computer and who privatised the UK&#8217;s phone network, has died. She was 87.</p>
<p>When Britain&#8217;s Iron Lady came to power in 1979, your average Brit had just one phone, which was fixed to a wall by a wire and connected to a network operated by a national monopoly: the Post Office. If you wanted to buy a phone or install a line, that was the organisation you had to go to.</p>
<p>And that was about to change.</p>
<p>As leader of the ruling Conservative Party, she pledged to slash red tape in the public sector: her mentor and subsequent minister for trade and industry Sir Keith Joseph told her deregulation in the US had liberating effects on the development and availability of technology.</p>
<p>Sir Keith was the architect of Thatcherism. And it was his advice that led to the denationalisation of Blighty&#8217;s phone system.</p>
<p>By 1980, the chunk of the Post Office that ran the country&#8217;s telephone network was renamed British Telecom.</p>
<p>(This was the same Post Office that, in the 1970s, snubbed one of the world&#8217;s first mobile telephones, which was designed by the British Chelmer Institute. The staggering decision to write off the tech, rather than deploy it, <strong><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/03/maggie_philbin_tomorrows_world_teen_role_models/page3.html" target="_blank">cleared the way for the Finns to rule the mobe roost</a></strong>.)</p>
<p>A year later in 1981, Thatcher&#8217;s British Telecommunications Act put Blighty&#8217;s phone network firmly on the road to privatisation: by 1984, British Telecommunications plc (now just BT plc) was trading shares, running British Telecom&#8217;s systems and, crucially, it lost its exclusive ownership of the entire communications market.</p>
<p>From then on, BT bosses had to come up with better technology and services to win customers in the face of fresh competition from private-sector operators &#8211; which could offer competing lines, phones and other products.</p>
<p>And lo, Brits can buy wired handsets made by Siemens, Panasonic or NEC; call someone from a field using kit designed by Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry or Nokia; and watch yesterday&#8217;s TV and browse <i>El Reg</i> over copper phone lines or Virgin Media&#8217;s fibre optic cable, to name a few names. You can read more about BT&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/Privatisationinfosheetissue2.pdf" target="_blank">privatisation saga here [PDF]</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Kickstarting the startups</strong></p>
<p>It was Thatcher&#8217;s love for the private sector that also injected a dose of entrepreneurial spirit into Blighty&#8217;s arm: her belief that anyone could achieve anything with the right idea at the right time appealed to many.</p>
<p>Her eventual low interest rates, axed bureaucracy, and low taxes encouraged British firms. The nation&#8217;s fledging computer hardware and software makers Acorn, <strong><a href="http://www.sage.com/ourbusiness/aboutus/ourhistory" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Sage</a></strong>, Sinclair and Amstrad hit their stride in and around Thatcher&#8217;s reign.</p>
<p>The 1980s British personal computer market was fiercely fought, turbulent and riddled with rotten luck, which partly explains why we&#8217;re not using Core i5-powered Sinclair machines today. But the biggest success was the ARM team that sprang from Acorn; its low-power RISC processor design is today the planet&#8217;s most popular embedded processor architecture.</p>
<p>Amstrad founder Lord Alan Sugar, who was one of Thatcher&#8217;s favourites, tweeted yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.old-and-bold.info/?attachment_id=18060" rel="attachment wp-att-18060"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18060" alt="Allan Sugar Tweet on Thatcher" src="//blog.old-and-bold.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Allan-Sugar-Tweet-on-Thatcher.png" width="465" height="400" /></a>Born in 1925 in Grantham, Lincolnshire, as Margaret Roberts, Thatcher, whose father was a grocer, entered the world of science and technology after leaving school.</p>
<p>She studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and graduated in 1947; worked for a plastics company; and (<strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-may-have-helped-invent-soft-serve-ice-cream/274767/" target="_blank">legend has it</a></strong>) helped invent soft ice cream as a food scientist in the laboratory of J Lyons &#8211; the catering giant that created <strong><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/27/geeks_guide_leo/" target="_blank">the world&#8217;s first business computer, the Lyons Electronic Office (LEO)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>She became an MP in 1959, and by the time she rose to the top of the Tory party, she had set her sights on privatising Britain&#8217;s shipbuilding and aerospace operations. Ex-premier Harold Macmillan, a leading Conservative, warned she was selling the family silver.</p>
<p>But telecoms was arguably the most successful of Thatcher&#8217;s deregulations. Without her personal belief and her change of the laws on regulation and private ownership, Britain&#8217;s comms network would have remained a closed market &#8211; with no alternative handsets and equipment and no competing communications services to keep the Post Office on its toes.</p>
<p>Blighty&#8217;s phone, and ultimately internet, connectivity may well have been in a completely different state without her intervention; we could all be using drab Post Office-issued handsets that attempt to outdo kit from global giants.</p>
<p>Some will counter that deregulation of telecoms and the rise of the computer entrepreneur were inevitable. But it was under Thatcher, who was ousted in 1990, that Britain witnessed its first semiconductor-powered hardware explosion, sowing the seeds for tech startups and the consumption of home electronics by the masses.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher has died following a stroke</strong></em></p>
<p>Judy Garland’s celebratory ditty ‘Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead’ from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ is heading for the Top 40 in the Official Singles Chart in the wake of <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/margaret-thatcher/?fr=fp-tts-702&amp;fr2=ps" target="_blank">Margaret Thatcher’s death</a>.</p>
<p>After the former prime minister died, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2807687628/?fref=ts%20" target="_blank">a Facebook</a> and Twitter campaign began to get the song to number one in the charts.</p>

<p>In the 1939 hit musical, Dorothy, the Munchkins and Glinda the Good Witch sing ‘Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead’ after Dorothy kills the Wicked Witch of the East by dropping a house on her.</p>
<p>The social media campaign around the song highlights how politically divisive Thatcher was.</p>
<p>She died at the Ritz hotel in London after suffering a stroke.</p>
<p>Reaction to Thatcher&#8217;s death from the world of film has been mixed.</p>
<p>Meryl Streep, who won an Oscar playing Thatcher in &#8216;The Iron Lady&#8217;, <a href="http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/streep-pays-tribute-to-margaret-thatcher-073102736.html" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>: “Margaret Thatcher was a pioneer, willingly or unwillingly, for the role of women in politics,” she said.</p>
<p>”It is hard to imagine a part of our current history that has not been affected by measures she put forward in the UK at the end of the 20th century.</p>
<p>“But to me she was a figure of awe for her personal strength and grit. To have come up, legitimately, through the ranks of the British political system, class bound and gender phobic as it was, in the time that she did and the way that she did, was a formidable achievement.”</p>
<p>Director Ken Loach had a rather different take on Thatcher, <a href="http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/ken-loach-wants-thatcher-s-funeral-privatised-091117524.html" target="_blank">calling for her funeral to be privatised</a>, saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s what she would&#8217;ve wanted&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Let’s privatise her funeral. Put it out to competitive tender and accept the cheapest bid.&#8221;</p>

						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignright" alt="Sir Norman Bettison" src="//news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/63691000/jpg/_63691187_63691186.jpg" width="224" height="299" /><em><strong>Sir Norman resigned as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A university has stripped Sir Norman Bettison of an honorary fellowship in the wake of the Hillsborough scandal.</strong></p>
<p>The former chief constable of West Yorkshire Police and Merseyside Police was given the honour by Liverpool John Moores University in 2004.</p>
<p>The honour was withdrawn after a report published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in March.</p>
<p>It said Sir Norman would have a &#8220;case to answer for gross misconduct&#8221; if he was a serving officer.</p>
<p>The Hillsborough families believe he was involved in a cover-up which attempted to lay blame for the tragedy on to the 96 victims.</p>
<p><strong>Families commended</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the disaster on 15 April 1989, he was a South Yorkshire Police inspector who attended the match as a spectator and later took part in an internal inquiry.</p>
<p>Sir Norman resigned as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police last October.</p>
<p>He said an inquiry into his role after the Hillsborough tragedy was &#8220;a distraction&#8221; to the force.</p>
<p>His police authority asked the IPCC to look at his role following the disaster, and this investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>Last month&#8217;s report related to a separate referral to the commission after allegations he interfered with the main referral process.</p>
<p>The IPCC said on 28 March that the issue was Sir Norman&#8217;s desire to refer himself to the commission and, therefore, control the process.</p>
<p>The report concluded: &#8220;It is concerning that his first thoughts appear to have been to protect his own position.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lawyers said in response that he had not been found guilty of anything.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Remove knighthood&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool John Moores University said: &#8220;In light of the conclusions published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, Liverpool John Moores University has withdrawn the honorary fellowship awarded to Sir Norman Bettison in 2004.</p>
<p>&#8220;As previously stated the university would like to commend the families and friends of those who died in the Hillsborough tragedy for the dignity and fortitude they have shown during their lengthy campaign for justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s great to know that John Moores University has done the right thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope now that the next step is the removal of his knighthood.&#8221;</p>

						<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>The Editor of the Old &amp; Bold Newsletter asked in the last edition if any members had any reminiscences about the harsh winter experienced in the UK during the winter of 1963/4.  </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Former Inspector in charge of the Dog Section, Stan &#8216;Timber&#8217; Wood MBE sent in the following: -</strong></em></span></p>
<div id="attachment_12311" style="width: 348px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.old-and-bold.info/?attachment_id=12311" rel="attachment wp-att-12311"><img class="size-full wp-image-12311" alt="'Timber' Wood MBE with a Mountbrowne bred Puppy" src="//blog.old-and-bold.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Timber-Wood-MBE-pup.jpg" width="338" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>&#8216;Timber&#8217; Wood MBE with a Mountbrowne bred Puppy</strong></em></p></div>
<p>My first memory of this hard winter was Boxing Night, 1962. I had just gone to the gate of our Police House in Farncombe to see my parents off after a day visit.  They were going back to their home near Haywards Heath, Sussex.  The snow had been falling all evening and the ground was well covered.</p>
<p>Next morning they were in contact as my Mum had lost her spectacles, she thought, near to where the car had been parked whilst on their visit.  I had a good check in the thick carpet of snow but to no avail.</p>
<p>In the New Year I took up a new job on the Dog Section, I was to join the Dog Training Staff at Mount Browne as ‘the boy’.  My job other than Kennel Duties was to be second assistant helping to run the police dog courses.  My boss was Sergeant Bob Ling, his assistant was Constable George Wraight.  They were without doubt two of the very best dog trainers in the country and I was extremely lucky to spend the next two years under their guidance.</p>
<p>1963 was the start of trained dogs and handlers returning to their Dog School for two week Refresher Courses and we had handlers attending from all over the country including Wales and Scotland.  The ‘lads’ from Hull would come by train  and when we picked them up from the station they would not only have their dog but a very welcome box of fresh fish.  This was also the first year of the competitive Regional Dog Trails and National Finals.</p>
<p>However, back to The Winter, 1963.  The snow laid on the ground until late March and each day I rode my bike from Farncombe to Mount Browne normally with my young police dog trotting by my side.</p>
<p>Work for the first hour was sweeping with the aid of the dog course and then dog food preparation.  When all this was completed I was to join the Course normally on the Sports Field where I was expected to run ‘criminal for up to two hours for the eight dog course.  We usually did at least two evenings searching local factories for a hidden criminal.</p>
<p>You guessed who ‘he’ would be, it was freezing cold particularly if I was hidden on a roof for up to two hours.</p>
<p>As the snow began to melt that March, I found my mother’s spectacles laying in the gutter outside of the house, they were intact.  By the by she celebrated her 105<sup>th</sup> birthday this April 1<sup>st</sup>.  real not April Fool!!.</p>
<p>The snow had gone by the time Surrey ran the first No 6 District Regional Dog Trial, the manwork was the last day attraction when all 28 dogs had ‘their turn’.  A young Fred Booker and myself were given to task of running criminal for them all.  That was Fred acting as criminal for 28 attacks against the stick and then the gun and yours truly running 28 chase to stops and 28 ‘so called’ standoffs.  I am not kidding.</p>
<div id="attachment_18039" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.old-and-bold.info/?attachment_id=18039" rel="attachment wp-att-18039"><img class="size-full wp-image-18039" alt="1964 at Shalford - 'Timber' Wood running criminal" src="//blog.old-and-bold.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Timber-Wood-as-criminal.jpg" width="375" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>1964 at Shalford &#8211; &#8216;Timber&#8217; Wood running criminal</strong></em></p></div>
<p>So ended The Winter, what I wasn’t to realize was that in 3 years both my Tutors were to leave Surrey, Bob Ling resigned in 1965 and George Wraight transferred to Bucks, later to be Thames Valley and the Dog School to my amazement was handed to me.</p>

<p><strong>Police Federation chairman says changes in the way questions are put to the Home Secretary at conference are necessary in the light of last year&#8217;s events.</strong></p>
<p>The Police Federation says it will not “vet” questions to the Home Secretary at its annual conference – but is picking them in advance to ensure she is held to account and a “constructive debate” takes place.</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Steve Williams (<em>pictured</em>) said Home Secretary Theresa May will face a “Question Time” styled approach on May 15 – similar to the one used on the BBC television programme.</p>
<p>But he said the Fed could not afford a repeat of last year’s reception to Mrs May, which “did us no favours in the eyes of the public and politicians alike”. This followed jeers and calls for Mrs May to resign after her speech in Bournemouth.</p>
<p>Mr Williams said: “The Home Secretary attends conference as a guest and is under no obligation to do so.</p>
<p>“While we all feel very valid anger, frustration and discontent as a result of the government&#8217;s police reform agenda, the behaviour displayed by some towards the Home Secretary at last year&#8217;s conference resulted in a deluge of negative press coverage and did us no favours in the eyes of the public and politicians alike.</p>
<p>“While conference represents a chance to convey those frustrations to the government, I would like to respectfully request that delegates do so in way that befits the fine profession and Police Service we are all so proud to be a part of.”</p>
<p>As exclusively revealed by PoliceOracle.com, the Fed is requiring attendees to submit their questions for consideration at least a day in advance of Mrs May’s speech. She will also have a chance to view the questions for a short while before taking to the stage.</p>
<p>However, Mr Williams said once each of the selected questions had been asked of Mrs May, delegates would then be able to ask follow-up questions after her initial response. This way, he said, members will still have the opportunity to address the Home Secretary directly.</p>
<p>The move to change the way questions are asked at conference had been criticised by some regional Federation branches as previous events have had an “open microphone” policy. This allowed delegates to queue up and ask their questions of the Home Secretary after he or she had made their speech.</p>
<p>But Mr Williams said yesterday (April 8): “I feel we have nothing to lose by offering the Home Secretary a limited amount of time to consider a response to the questions, indeed it would prevent her from saying that she does not have the information at hand to answer a particular question and will provide the opportunity for a fuller, more detailed response.”</p>
<p>He added: “Conference represents a unique opportunity for delegates to challenge the Home Secretary first-hand and I believe the revised &#8216;Question Time&#8217;-style format will ensure that the Home Secretary is presented with a broad range of salient and thought-provoking questions.</p>
<p>“While the exact details are yet to be confirmed, I expect that delegates will have until the evening before the session to submit questions.”</p>
<p>Mrs May has already told PoliceOracle.com that she is willing to take unseen questions “from whomever and on whatever” at the conference.</p>
<p>She said seeing the approved questions in advance was also unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mr Williams said he regretted that he was unable to tell members of the changes to the question format before it was reported.</p>
<p>He said: “Contrary to what has been reported, this arrangement is not so that we can &#8216;vet&#8217; the questions, but to ensure that the session produces the most constructive debate possible.”</p>

						<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>I have always thought that Douglas Hurd should have gone further than he did.  A thoughtful, intelligent and articulate person I thought this résumé of his time with Maggie Thatcher one of the better summaries of her amongst all the hype in the papers today.  </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Although Maggie famously said, &#8216;the lady&#8217;s not for turning&#8217; maybe her achilles heel was not knowing when to die in a ditch for something and when not to.</strong></em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.old-and-bold.info/?attachment_id=18007" rel="attachment wp-att-18007"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18007" alt="Margaret Thatcher and Douglas Hurd" src="//blog.old-and-bold.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Margaret-Thatcher-and-Douglas-Hurd.png" width="450" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>In or around the year 1978, I visited the biggest single employer in my constituency – it manufactured car parts on the hill above Witney in Oxfordshire.</p>
<p>I was new to the job and asked the management naively how they were getting on with their business plan. They looked at me with pity. “We have no business plan,” they replied. “We do our best to find out the mood of the shop stewards at Cowley and then calculate as best we can how many cars we think they will allow to be produced next week and next month.”</p>
<p>That was the Britain which Margaret Thatcher <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/how-thatcher-changed-britain-8564673.html" target="_blank">took over</a> in 1979. Ted Heath had tried to bring common sense into industrial relations through one massive measure, the Industrial Relations Act. That had failed and Mrs Thatcher learned from the failure in making her own plans. The necessary legislation was brought forward piece by piece, Secretary of State by Secretary of State. When the challenge finally came from the coal miners, Mrs Thatcher was ready. She could not afford to fail against Arthur Scargill. This, rather than the Falklands War, was the crucial moment of her premiership. Her temperament ruled out talk of compromise or conciliation. She took the risk, and won.</p>
<p>I was never an intimate of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/margaret-thatcher-saved-the-british-economy-but-at-too-high-a-social-cost-8564674.html" target="_blank">Mrs Thatcher</a>. I did not gain or seek admission to that coterie which, under the inspiration of Keith Joseph, had brought a sufficient majority of Conservatives to turn away from the One-Nation Conservatism of Ted Heath and towards a monetarist explanation of inflation. Mrs Thatcher knew that Heath, however bad-tempered, was not planning a counter-revolution; he was too proud to plot. This meant that she had a reasonable prospect of attracting to herself the loyalty of his supporters, since he was no longer in the field. She expected and rewarded that loyalty.</p>
<p>Some of us tried to introduce some variation into the crashing certainties of Thatcherism. In 1988, for example, the Home Office celebrated the anniversary of Robert Peel’s birth. I made a couple of speeches praising the concept of “the active citizen”. These went down quite well and Margaret congratulated me on their success, but she was intellectually honest and could never bring herself to utter any words which might imply that, after all, the lady was for turning. We were allowed to introduce some grace notes into the composition, so long as we were ready, at the end, to join in the triumphant chorus. Mine was a valid interpretation of the Conservative creed, but it was not her version. My words would have stuck in her throat. Since most of us believed that the Prime Minister was honourably devoted to the public good, we were broadly content with this arrangement.</p>
<p>Mrs Thatcher did nothing to discourage the popular myth that she, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/thatcher-the-lady-with-the-handbag-became-as-recognisable-as-churchill-and-his-cigar-8564860.html" target="_blank">with her handbag</a>, was constantly interfering in the detail of how her ministers did their jobs. She relished the idea that she was everywhere and knew everything. For example, I had no reason to complain of interference in Home Office matters. Apart from broadcasting, where she held strong but internally inconsistent views, she seemed to realise that being Home Secretary was a difficult job which she should not complicate by meddling. I knew that she held strong views in favour of capital punishment but never once in five years did she suggest that we should reintroduce it. There were occasional moments of awkwardness each year at the Party Conference, but that was a small price to pay for her reticence on the subject when it mattered. For the rest, she disliked being taken by surprise – for example, by a prison riot or a police scandal. On such occasions, I needed her support in Cabinet, and, once she had been warned, almost always got it.</p>
<p>In his famous valedictory dispatch from Paris in March 1979, the then British Ambassador to France Sir Nicholas Henderson put the case for a dramatic effort to rebuild public morale in Britain as President de Gaulle had managed to do in France. Within months, Mrs Thatcher <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-heroine-and-a-hate-figure-indifference-wasnt-an-option-when-it-came-to-lady-thatcher-8564563.html" target="_blank">was in power</a> and his wish was granted. She believed, like Disraeli, that national prestige was an asset, the store of which we should always be trying to increase. She was tireless in this effort, though sometimes misguided. It was futile to try to hold up German reunification, on which the United States as well as German governments were insistent. President Mitterrand and Mr Gorbachev were playing their own quite different hands with no particular regard for us.</p>
<p>The Falkland Islands were a different matter. Mrs Thatcher’s determined and straightforward stand baffled but impressed our more sophisticated allies, who were constantly looking for some hidden motive which did not exist. I remember a visit by President Mitterrand soon after the victory. The French, briefed no doubt by the Elysée, had warned us that the President would press for lenient treatment of the defeated Argentines. Instead, at the outset he had said: “You have shown again what we French have known for centuries – one must not play games with the English.” The Prime Minister glowed at that, and the rest of the meeting went well.</p>
<p>On Europe, her compromising tactics produced a steadily diminishing return. She made substantial gains at the outset, particularly over the British rebate; but her refusal to give ground even on small matters began to irritate her partners. They had no compunction in ambushing her, for example under the Italian presidency at the last summit which she attended in 1990.</p>
<p>The end came sooner than I expected. A combination of anxiety over her European tactics and dismay over the poll tax meant that she failed to establish a solid lead over Michael Heseltine that November. Although the European partners carried some scars from their encounters with her, they were baffled and sad at the thought that a trap door might suddenly open and remove her from the European scene.</p>
<p>President Mitterrand held a banquet in honour of the Security Treaty which she had joined in signing that day. Among the glitter of glass and silver at Versailles that night, some of them cross-examined me as to how a Prime Minister with a strong majority in the House of Commons was in danger. It seemed to them (and to me) an unseemly way of changing a government. Maddening though Margaret could be, she was a familiar part of the European scene and they found it strange and uncomfortable that she was under threat.</p>
<p>I did not join with those members of the Cabinet who the next day, in their separate meetings with her, advised her to stand down. I had taken too seriously the ovation which she had received at the recent party conference. I always thoroughly disliked the artificial enthusiasm which the leader’s conference speech habitually generated, but in 1990 I thought it solid enough to see her through. I underestimated the strength of the current already running against her. But she carried herself bravely and I was proud of her that evening at Versailles.</p>

						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignright" alt="PC Ian Dibell" src="//news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/61532000/jpg/_61532972_tv015287026.jpg" width="304" height="171" /><em><strong>PC Ian Dibell was killed while trying to stop a shooting in Essex</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A policeman fatally shot as he tried to wrestle a weapon from a gunman should be awarded a medal, a coroner has said.</strong></p>
<p>Off-duty PC Ian Dibell, 41, a father of two, was &#8220;unlawfully killed&#8221; near his home in Clacton-on-Sea last July.</p>
<p>An inquest in Chelmsford heard he was shot as he tried to stop Peter Reeve, 64, firing a revolver at two members of the public.</p>
<p>Mr Reeve told his sister she would not see him again before killing himself the next day at a Writtle churchyard.</p>
<p>Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said PC Dibell should be awarded a medal for &#8220;gallantry&#8221; for his actions.</p>
<p>Ballistics expert Dr Philip Alexander told the hearing the gun used to kill the officer was a World War I revolver.</p>
<p>PC Dibell had come to the aid of Trevor Marshall and his girlfriend Katarzyna Karolak.</p>
<p>Mr Reeve, the couple&#8217;s neighbour, was shooting at them in the street, the inquest heard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignright" alt="Peter Reeve captured on CCTV aboard the Weeley to Colchester train after he shot PC Ian Dibell" src="//news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/66809000/jpg/_66809924_iandibellinquest_-_image3.jpg" width="304" height="171" /><em><strong>Peter Reeve captured on CCTV aboard the Weeley to Colchester train after he shot PC Ian Dibell</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Shot through palm</strong></p>
<p>Mr Reeve then got in his blue Toyota car and chased after them, firing shots from the window.</p>
<p>PC Dibell approached Mr Reeve&#8217;s car window and tried to grab the gun&#8217;s muzzle.</p>
<p>But the weapon went off, firing a round through the palm of PC Dibell&#8217;s hand and into his chest.</p>
<p>After PC Dibell was shot, a large police manhunt was mounted to search for Mr Reeve.</p>
<p>His body was found the following day. He had a single gunshot wound through the forehead.</p>
<p>The inquest heard Mr Reeve, a former mechanic, was diagnosed with paranoia and psychosis in 2001.</p>
<p>He had become obsessed with the idea that his neighbours were dealing drugs and printing money, the hearing was told.</p>
<p>After killing PC Dibell, who died of a wound to his aorta and a collapsed lung, Mr Reeve got on a train to Chelmsford.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignright" alt="1917 Webley and Scott revolver" src="//news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/66809000/jpg/_66809926_iandibellinquest_-_image5.jpg" width="304" height="171" /><em><strong>The gun used by Peter Reeve was this 1917 Webley and Scott revolver</strong></em></p>
<p>He went to see his sister Janet Hynes in the town and told her: &#8220;You won&#8217;t see me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verdicts that PC Dibell was unlawfully killed and Mr Reeve killed himself were recorded.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Never be forgotten&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>After the hearing, PC Dibell&#8217;s family released a statement saying he had &#8220;acted selflessly and heroically&#8221; and paid the &#8220;ultimate price&#8221;.</p>
<p>His partner Louise Lilley said the inquest had provided &#8220;some much needed closure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chief Constable Jim Barker-McCardle said: &#8220;The incident in Clacton last July is a reminder to us all that it is not the uniform that makes a police officer, it is the instinctive sense to do the right thing regardless of the circumstances you are faced with.</p>
<p>&#8220;We remain deeply proud of Ian and the sacrifice he made for the safety of others.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had an incredible devotion to his community and Essex Police and his actions will never be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

						<p><strong>A trojan that can hijack a computer and force it into mining for Bitcoins &#8211; the virtual currency &#8211; has been spreading via Skype.</strong></p>
<p>Antivirus firm Kaspersky Labs said attackers sent messages in various languages translating to &#8220;this my favourite picture of you&#8221;. The message included a malicious link which was, at its peak, being accessed more than 2,000 times every hour.</p>
<p>The value of Bitcoin has grown massively in recent weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchange website Mt Gox has the currency listed as being worth $186 (£121).</p>
<p><strong>CPU abuse</strong></p>
<p>Unlike other currencies, Bitcoins are not issued by a central bank or other centralised authority. Instead users are rewarded in a process called &#8220;mining&#8221;, in which coins are issued to a user when they solve a complicated mathematical problem using their computer.</p>
<p>The trojan hijacks a victim&#8217;s machine and makes it mine for Bitcoins on the attacker&#8217;s behalf. The greater the number of machines mining, the quicker coins will be harvested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the potential victims live in Italy then Russia, Poland, Costa Rica, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and others,&#8221; wrote Dmitry Bestuzhev from Kaspersky Labs in a <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208194210/Skypemageddon_by_bitcoining" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The attack &#8220;dropper&#8221; originates from a server in India, but once installed transmits information back to a control centre in Germany, Mr Bestuzhev wrote.</p>
<p>The trojan is able to carry out many tasks, he added, but taking over computers for Bitcoin mining appears to be its primary function. &#8220;It abuses the CPU of infected machines to mine Bitcoins for the criminal. The campaign is quite active. If you see your machine is working hard, using all available CPU resources, you may be infected.&#8221;<br />
