<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I
didn&#8217;t make it until noon.&nbsp; The moment I
had written &#8220;zoo animal&#8221; that is what I felt like. I felt trapped and confined
in what is actually a rather spacious hotel room.&nbsp; I made the decision that I would go out just
for a short walk.&nbsp; <i>Turn to the right,</i>&nbsp;I
said to myself, <i>just walk straight and don&#8217;t cross any streets.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just check it out before I felt more
confined and unwilling to get out into Taiwan.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
goals would be simple and attainable.&nbsp;
Stay out for an hour, find an ATM, get some money, and find a
store.&nbsp; After much pacing back and forth
in my room, preparing for a short stroll as though I was preparing to set off
cross country (though I suppose that is easier in Taiwan than other places) I
left my hotel for the first time.&nbsp; A
quick glance to the right revealed that there were no sidewalks to be had.&nbsp; &#8220;Left,&#8221; I said out loud, hoping that it would
stick better that way after repearing 'right' to myself a million times before that.&nbsp; I turned to the
left in time to catch a young man taking a photo of me.&nbsp; I shot him a glare and he responded by taking
another photo.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Now I truly felt like I had returned to Asia.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though
I had strolled so confidently past the hotel lobby where Comedy and Tragedy
still sat, I realized that I needed help finding an ATM.&nbsp; I recalled their inability to speak English and
flipped open my China language guide to the short section on Mandarin and found
the word for ATM.&nbsp; I walked up to them
confidently.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comedy
picked up the phone as I walked in and began making a call, she pointed to
Tragedy and I got the feeling that she simply didn&#8217;t want to talk to me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Great&#8230;</i>&nbsp;I thought sourly to myself.&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Ni hao</i>!&#8221; I
said with a smile.&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Nali</i>,&#8221; this time I
got the tones of the word sorted, falling raising, and then falling for
&#8220;where&#8221;.&nbsp; I opened my mouth to read the
word for ATM, but I faltered, &#8220;Zidong&#8230;uh&#8230;zi&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;
I turned the book over and pointed at the Chinese characters for her to
read. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Zidong
qukuanji?&nbsp; You need to find an ATM?&#8221; she
asked.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could
only blink for several moments.&nbsp;
&#8220;Um&#8230;yes.&nbsp; Yes.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay!&#8221;
she said with a smile. &nbsp;&#8220;Come with
me.&nbsp; I will show you.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I
followed her back into the heat of the day, the rough streets of Taoyuan City.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still
animated, she turned back to face me, a look of almost panic across her
face.&nbsp; &#8220;You need an ATM?&nbsp; Or you need to exchange money?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook
my head, &#8220;An ATM is fine.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her
bright smile returned.&nbsp; She held her hand
to the left, &#8220;There is a 7-11 there.&nbsp;
They have ATM.&nbsp; But,&#8221; she
motioned kitty-corner, just across the street, &#8220;If you have to exchange money
there is a bank there.&nbsp; You can exchange
money there.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t have to exchange money.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;But
you can there,&#8221; she reminded me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
nodded in understanding.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
nodded back with a final sort of, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
thanked her and set about my tasks for the day, wishing I hadn&#8217;t nicknamed her
Tragedy the night before as it seemed wholly inappropriate in the light of day.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taoyuan
was not what I had been promised at all.&nbsp;
Taipei.&nbsp; How many times had I been
told Taipei?&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t yet seen Taipei,
but I imagined it with sidewalks.&nbsp; I
hopped here and there in order to cross the street, weaving through crowded and
narrow sidewalks (crowded with scooters awaiting repair and boxes of who knows
what) before I had to jump down and into the lanes of oncoming traffic when the
sidewalk suddenly disappeared.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
trek to the 7-11 wasn&#8217;t all that bad.&nbsp;
There was sidewalk most of the way and the ATM was pushed into the
corner next to the hot coffee like it had been for all of the Korean convenient
stores (and maybe in US stores too, but I never need cash there).&nbsp; Upon feeding the machine my card it gave me
the option of English and things proceeded smoothly.&nbsp; It would have been less so had I not deleted
a 0 when I nearly took out 30,000 NT, which would have been near 1000 USD when
I wanted only 100USD.&nbsp; But crisis
averted, I had completed the tasks of finding an ATM and getting some money.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
next task was mostly burning the clock.&nbsp;
I thought how much of a baby I was being.&nbsp; I told myself that I was saying that Taoyuan
had nothing of interest to put off being brave and adventurous.&nbsp; But as I walked I began to wonder if this was
true.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More
scooter shops. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty
storefronts.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chain
burger joint that had seen far better days (I could only hope).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I
could turn down this street and-nope, just brick walls.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
been out about forty-five minutes and decided that I had been right to start
with. Taoyuan sucks.&nbsp; Villahermosa level
sucks.&nbsp; I headed back towards my hotel,
keeping a better eye out for a grocery store of some sort.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently
while I had been focused on 7-11 I had not noticed the store directly next door
to the hotel.&nbsp; My last task was waiting
for me upon my return.&nbsp; I entered and
drew looks from all around, but felt a sense of pride in having dragged my jet-lagged
ass out of my room to actually get something done instead of waiting for my
next meal to arrive.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Alright,
Chelsea.</i>&nbsp;I thought to myself.&nbsp; <i>Find
something you&#8217;ve never had or seen before and buy it.&nbsp; Ooo! Is that kimchi!?!&nbsp; No&#8230;focus&#8230;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had seen all of it before.&nbsp;
Produce lined one side in open refrigerated shelves: fruits I had eaten,
kimchi, milks and yogurts, eggs, tofu, lotus root.&nbsp; I could name everything in that aisle.&nbsp; On the opposite side was microwave meals of
curries and such, but without a microwave, even if it was brand new, I couldn&#8217;t
eat it.&nbsp; Ramen and pasta filled the next
aisle.&nbsp; The ramen, or ramyun in this
case, was even the famous Korean brand.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally
I grabbed carrot cookies, putting back the pineapple cake knowing it couldn&#8217;t
actually be that different, as well as the kimchi and some &#8220;ohayo&#8221; brand
chopsticks.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t feel terribly
Taiwanese, but at least carrot cookies was something.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
returned to my room with plenty of time before noon and snacked slowly on my
items, waiting for my food.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
never came. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the
time two o&#8217; clock rolled around I had given up on it and finished my purchased
food.&nbsp; I was thoroughly confused as to
what this &#8220;provided food&#8221; meant.&nbsp; Perhaps
I was meant to drink the tea for breakfast and have the burger for lunch?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nap
would make me feel better I decided.&nbsp; I
have an inability to nap in most circumstances, but I was worn out enough that
I thought I would give it a shot.&nbsp; I
crawled into bed, setting my dress to the side and sleeping in my underwear.&nbsp; After a lot of moving this way and that in
the sunlight filled room, I felt that I might drift off to sleep.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knock,
knock.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
didn&#8217;t take another set of knocks for me to lunge out of bed.&nbsp; I had my dress in hand but it had got twisted
up in its cut out back.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could
hear women speaking in Chinese outside of my door.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t know what to say to make them
not come in.&nbsp; I continued to struggle
with my dress as their key turned in my door.&nbsp;
&#8220;Yes!&#8221; I called out.&nbsp; &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
were not thwarted by my clever tactics.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dress
still tangled up in itself I slid it over myself, finding only one arm hole to
use, but being mostly covered.&nbsp; I stepped
out from around the corner to block their entrance into my room.&nbsp; &#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,
my way with words did not serve me.&nbsp; They
stood at me, taking in my sleepy eyes, disheveled hair, and bright blue
bra-strap where there ought to be a sleeve.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
spoke to me in Chinese.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uh&#8230;&#8221; I
could only shake my head and continue to block their entrance.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Bu
yao,&#8221; the woman said.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew
that one!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t want.&nbsp; &#8220;Bu yao,&#8221; I repeated, shaking my hands in
front of me and shaking my head.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both
women, the one in my room with a mop and the one behind her pushing a small
cart, began to laugh boisterously.&nbsp;
&#8220;Sorry, sorry,&#8221; the with the mop one said through her laughter as she left and shut
the door behind her.&nbsp; I heard them laugh
all the way down the hallway.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
wondered as I dragged myself back to bed if they had been coming to see the
leak I had been complaining about.&nbsp; But
there wasn&#8217;t anything I could do about it.&nbsp;
My productivity was limited to deciding to nap clothed.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
second nap attempt was interrupted as well.&nbsp;
I begrudgingly returned to the door to find Tragedy ready to inspect the
leak and take me to my new room.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I will
take you there.&nbsp; And you can say if it is
okay or no,&#8221; she offered.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I
changed rooms to a nearly identical one, except this one had no leak.&nbsp; I took the key back downstairs and was
surprised by the &#8220;pack&#8221; that I had been promised.&nbsp; I took the one for my roommate who would be
coming very shortly at that point.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T-shirts
and instructions for the camp came in the pack, as well as my food allowance
and an explanation that the hotel provided breakfast.&nbsp; Hence the burger.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night, my roommate
arrived.&nbsp; Instead of a full of herself,
didn&#8217;t want to travel with me, twenty-something Joanna that I had created in my
head, a mature, retired lawyer Joan showed up.&nbsp; We chatted for a while about our combined
awkward experiences and decided that we both wanted to head out to explore
Taipei the next day and would do so together.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our day ought to have started
far earlier than it did.&nbsp; But we wanted
our free breakfast, damn it.&nbsp; I told Joan
that my food had shown up about 8am the day before, and so we sat and chatted and
planned for the day until nearly 9 before we saw fit to ask if food was going
to come.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tragedy and a young man were at
the front desk when I arrived to ask.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Is there going to be
breakfast?&#8221; I wanted to be clear, but tried my best not to sound presumptuous. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me a bit confused,
as though she had not heard me correctly.&nbsp;
&#8220;Uh&#8230;yes.&nbsp; Here,&#8221; she motioned with
her hand but moved out from behind the counter deciding it would be best to
walk us there.&nbsp; &#8220;The restaurant has
breakfast.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just beyond the hotel lobby was
a room of vacant tables and a buffet line of Taiwanese fare.&nbsp; There were side dishes of cabbage, greens,
rice noodles, eggs, and much more, plenty to ensure I didn&#8217;t have to ingest a
single bite of meat!&nbsp; There was rice and
porridge, coffee and milk tea. &nbsp;Steamed
buns, this first steamed buns I had ever seen without filling, sat in a warmer,
ready to eat.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We filled our plates to
overflowing and sipped coffee leisurely once we had eaten.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the provided breakfast.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea why I had
received a burger the day before.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; Joan called to
Tragedy as we finished and were ready to leave.&nbsp;
&#8220;Thank you very much!&nbsp; My
name.&nbsp; Is Joan.&nbsp; What is your name?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked surprised.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh.&nbsp;
My name Rita,&#8221; she said with as smile and a jerking sort of bow.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t thought to ask since,
the first night, it seemed so clear that she didn&#8217;t speak any English and that
my shortest attempts at Chinese were unintelligible.&nbsp; But Rita.&nbsp;
That seemed much more appropriate than Tragedy.&nbsp; I introduced myself as well with a bow,
thanking her and the others in the restaurant for a wonderful breakfast.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed with a bus number and a
plan for the day I asked Rita how to get to the bus station.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed appalled.&nbsp; &#8220;Where will you go?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Taipei.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You take the train.&nbsp; It is very convenient.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And convenient it was.&nbsp; It was between a five and ten minute walk
from our hotel and fairly simple.&nbsp; We purchased
a public transit card (a yoyoca) at the same 7-11 where I took out money and loaded
it at the same counter.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
FIRST TIME ON
TRA/MRT</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help but think that
Taiwan&#8217;s public transit system was a lot like Korea&#8217;s.&nbsp; For those of you without that particular
frame of reference: good. &nbsp;It is really
good.&nbsp; We stood at the train station,
having walked through the queue and scanning our yoyoca.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the TRA, the train that we
needed to take from Taoyuan City into Taipei, and that goes all over Taiwan as
well, as well as the MRT, the metro system within Taipei, you pay the same as
in Korea: by distance.&nbsp; You scan when you
enter and you scan when you leave at it charges you accordingly.&nbsp; However, buses are different as we would find
out when we tried to scan our cards the same way.&nbsp; You only pay once for buses as it is a flat
rate.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Is&#8230;is this the right one&#8230;?&#8221; we
stared at the signs, every last one of them in Chinese, and then at the tracks
across the way.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Joan asked to a
young, shy looking Taiwanese woman, &#8220;Do you speak English?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman giggled and shook her
head and hands, &#8220;No.&#8221; she said through a laugh, repeating it six or so more
times to be sure we didn&#8217;t try to speak to her any more.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Taipei?&#8221; Joan continued.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman covered her mouth and
turned towards her boyfriend, who had also begun laughing and was physically
turning the woman back to us and egging her on.&nbsp;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she finally managed.&nbsp; &#8220;Taipei.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good enough.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited patiently for our
train to arrive and, as we were doing so, another woman, this one perhaps in
her late forties or early fifties, came up to us.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal.&nbsp; This woman had lived in the US for the past
27 years with her husband of the time, and then to continue raising her
daughter who hated Taiwan.&nbsp; She told us
about how, now that her daughter is in law school, she had purchased a condo in
DC flat out and given it to her daughter.&nbsp;
In doing so she felt that her motherly duties had been fulfilled and she
had come back to the country she had missed so much.&nbsp; She was very proud of all the progress that
Taiwan had made and was thrilled to be back.&nbsp;
She was maybe more thrilled to tell us all about it and appoint herself
our guide to public transit.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It brought me back to Mexico
City.&nbsp; Like Mexico City&#8217;s metro, Taipei&#8217;s
MRT consists of lines from one end to the other, no loops, and you simply find
the last station on either end and that tells you which direction you will be
going.&nbsp; It is also color-coded, making it
a snap to follow.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But unlike the sweet unnamed
woman in Mexico, Crystal insisted.&nbsp; She
lead us through transferring at the Taipei Main Station and showed us to follow
the signs labeled &#8220;MRT&#8221; and then the signs with our needed color to get to the
right place.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that, she left.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to navigate the MRT
is to download the app &#8220;TaipeiMetro&#8221;.&nbsp; It
is just a map, but this map is in both English and Chinese, making it easy for
English speakers to read, and easy to ask the locals for directions as you can
just point to the Chinese.&nbsp; Though there
are no shortages of Crystals to get you from point A to point B if your eyes
are big and confused enough.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
CHIANG KAI-SHEK
MEMORIAL</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just off of the red line (line
2) or the green line (line 3), Chiang Kia-Shek Memorial Hall has its own stop
and, once you get up on the street, it is hard to miss.&nbsp; The hall and its surrounding buildings are
enormous and gaudy.&nbsp; The colors of the
hall, having been finished in 1980 hasn&#8217;t had time to fade and stood out
brightly against the much more subdued blue of the sky.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We came upon it on the side of
the concert hall and assumed we had to walk through the building.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I think that that&#8217;s just a gift
shop,&#8221; I called to Joan who had stepped up to a door.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she hadn&#8217;t been thinking of
the memorial hall, she had been dreaming of air conditioning.&nbsp; &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s just step in for a bit.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stepped into the AC and moved
to the right hand side first, a book shop with little trinkets, but they weren&#8217;t
really themed for the building they resided in.&nbsp;
I stumbled upon packs of postcards that I thought were perfect, though I
would find out later that they were the same postcards sold at every major
sight in Taipei.&nbsp; I was excited anyway
and purchased them along with the proper postage for them to make it to their
destination.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other side of the air
conditioning, er, I mean room, was a sort of café.&nbsp; I ordered myself papaya milk, something I had
never tasted before, and sat down to start to write some postcards and enjoy
the coolness o f the room while I could.</div>

food we moved through the quiet building until we reached a door to the
outdoors where we stepped onto the center complex.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiles were arranged in
partial circles going this was and that.&nbsp;
It had a dizzying effect that brought my eyes upward and away from the
ground, but it stretched on so far that it was hard to fully look away while
still taking in the scene around me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

up the stairs to the concert hall some Taiwanese were practicing choreography
with fans.&nbsp; Across the way there was
music, and behind us there was construction going on.&nbsp; With all of this real life going on in all
directions, myself and the other tourists seemed to be funneled from the square
in the center towards the memorial hall.</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 89.&nbsp; That is how many steps were supposed to be
from the ground up to his statue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t
know why I couldn&#8217;t take their word for it.&nbsp;
Joan was appreciating the beauty of the sights around us a speaking to me, but I only
offered back uninterested &#8220;uh-huh&#8221;s and nods as I focused on my counting.<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">

us.&nbsp; A flag sat on either side and, a
little bit closer to the velvet ropes keeping us at bay, stood two life-sized
statues of guards.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fuck!</i> &nbsp;My heart leapt into my throat as I realized that
those unmoving statues were people.&nbsp; I
don&#8217;t know why it caused me such a jolt, but felt better when it caused Joan
the same level of distress.&nbsp; The stared
blankly at one another and I found myself staring at the one to the right,
waiting for him to move or blink or falter in some way.&nbsp; But it didn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; I did, however, catch the other one shift
unsteadily on his feet and fight back a smile.&nbsp;
My head snapped to the other side hoping to catch the one on the right
cracking a smile back at the one on the left.&nbsp;
No such luck.</div>

simply too big to get a decent picture and I had to settle for a less than
mediocre one and some extra gawking to make up for it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information desk informed us

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until I had already
showed them the Chinese characters in my Lonely Planet and flashed them a smile
that I realized I had asked the wrong people.&nbsp;
I made a mental note that this was what Taiwanese hooligans looked
like.&nbsp; But it was too late.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t about to show them that their cold
stares and snarling frowns made me nervous.&nbsp;
They dismissed me with some angry sounding Chinese and a woman with
short-cropped hair stood, dropping her cigarette and looking at me
challengingly.&nbsp; She stood at maybe 5&#8217;1&#8217;&#8217;,
but I decided to give them a quick bow, a &#8220;<i>Xiexie</i>&#8221; and take my leave.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;They didn&#8217;t know?&#8221; Joan asked when

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head, &#8220;I guess not,&#8221;

else.</div>

Building in the distance before us and knowing that the Chiang Kai-Shek
Memorial Hall was behind us, we are able orient ourselves and easily find the
park to our right.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This park is dedicated to those
who died in the series of massacres that began on February 28<sup>th</sup>,
1947.&nbsp; While it was a beautiful park with
water features, plants, paths, and playgrounds with children running about,
there was a peaceful and respectful sort of silence, even in the midst of
Taipei.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming upon a stone foot path, I
paused.&nbsp; Looking both ways as though I were
about to cross the street, I considered continuing on, but found myself
slipping off my flats and gathering my maxi skirt in one hand.&nbsp; The feeling couldn&#8217;t be described as pleasant
or comfortable.&nbsp; I started down the path
with every intention to take just a few steps, but ended up all the way down
the path before I realized this meant I would have to walk all the way back
again.&nbsp; At the other end, Joan passed off
her phone to a Japanese tourist and joined me on the path.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched as the pain registered
on her face and she reached out to grab my arm for support, relieving her own
discomfort by pushing me farther down into the stone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I let out a combined scream of pain and a
laugh as Joan continued with her &#8220;oh, oh, oh&#8230;ow&#8230;oh&#8230;&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked by the 2-28 Memorial
Museum and saw the white ribbons and photos mourning the loss of life in the
terrible massacres.&nbsp; I used the lack of
English in the museum as an excuse not to go in, but if truth be told I simply
wasn&#8217;t ready to go from a stroll in the park and laughing on the stone path to
hearing of the horrible acts of violence that people are capable of.&nbsp; We continued on and I made an effort not to
look back on the ribbons, but they had left a weight on me. </div>

point, and the sun was unforgiving.&nbsp;
Clouds loomed someplace off on the horizon, but served only as a tease
and a source of more humidity.&nbsp; And also
to be a blemish on my pictures of the Presidential Office Building.&nbsp; The walk towards the enormous red and white
building was full of wondering if we could go in.&nbsp; The guidebook spoke of &#8220;exhibits&#8221;, but was I
reading the correct entry?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another tourist asked us to take
her picture and we decided to ask her.&nbsp;
She informed us that you had to make an appointment &#8220;three days in
advance&#8221;, which she hadn&#8217;t done either.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;ll just ask,&#8221; Joan
said.&nbsp; &#8220;If we start walking past what
would they do?&#8221;&nbsp; She joked (I hoped she
was joking) that if we don&#8217;t get kicked out of at least one building then it
wasn&#8217;t an adventure.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we got closer I asked her to
pick a building to get kicked out of that wasn&#8217;t surrounded by armed guards and
army trucks.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t look terribly
inviting.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lowered my eyes as we turned
the corner on the block and a helmeted man holding a gun over half as long as
the man was tall.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
XIMENDING</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say how thrilled I am
with the openness and helpfulness of the Taiwanese people.&nbsp; They truly want to share their country with
you and make sure that you find anything and everything you need. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, this woman was
not going to find what we wanted.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tactic in these circumstances
was to thank them and wait until they leave to find what I really wanted.&nbsp; But this wasn&#8217;t meshing well.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; Joan said, &#8220;Not just
coffee.&nbsp; Food.&#8221;&nbsp; She pantomimed eating for the woman. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, who had walked us
more than a dozen blocks to this particular café spoke in Chinese with the woman
working there.&nbsp; She turned back to us
after a lengthy discussion.&nbsp; &#8220;You can buy
bread downstairs and bring it up her and drink coffee and eat your bread.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Joan or I could say I word
she had lead us back into the elevator.&nbsp;
The doors chimed as they opened happily back into the humidity and the
woman motioned us towards to the affiliated bakery.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke before anyone else
could, &#8220;Thank you for all your help!&nbsp; We
will look around.&#8221;&nbsp; I gave her a smile
and she smiled back, wishing us a wonderful time in Taiwan and hurrying off to
whatever she had been doing before she had appointed herself our guide.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan said that she didn&#8217;t particularly
want to eat bread and I told her that I was in agreement, but that that woman
was going to show us a million places when it would be easier to just walk
through the shopping district and find something. &nbsp;Joan nodded in agreement. &nbsp;"Coffee maker," she said. &nbsp;We had come up with this expression after the men at breakfast kindly spent well over half and hour trying to figure out a coffee maker in order to give us coffee that was nice, but had become much more important to them than it was to us.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked down several streets
that sold only shoes, followed by only clothing stores, and moved through
Ximending in this fashion.&nbsp; Logically we
thought we would come across a section that was only food.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped only briefly at a
vendor selling some sort of liquid that I was ready to purchase before I was
pulled away.&nbsp; We had been appointed another
guide.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one took us quite a ways
telling us she would take us to good food.&nbsp;
It was several blocks before she announced that we were nearly to the
Japanese restaurant.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Is there Taiwanese food?&#8221; I
asked hopefully.&nbsp; I honestly hadn&#8217;t seen
any.&nbsp; Not street food or restaurants or
anything but Japanese food for days, maybe 6 McDonalds, MosBurgers, HotBurgers,
and on and on.&nbsp; What did the Taiwanese
people eat?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Taiwanese food?!&#8221; she stopped
in her tracks and looked back at me in almost disgust.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to stop just as
abruptly, but nearly walked right into her.&nbsp;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said as I righted myself once more.&nbsp; &#8220;What is a good Taiwanese food?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Beef noodle soup?&#8221; she asked as
though I was the one to know.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel the corners of my
mouth turn down at the word &#8220;beef&#8221;.&nbsp; I
had to remember that, like in Korea, this month broth was simply a reality for
me.&nbsp; So I nodded.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place she took us to was
cooled by a tiny and ineffective fan and the free cold tea they offered.&nbsp; The menu fortunately came in English, but the
sheet of paper they handed us that we were expected to check off what we wanted
did no.&nbsp; I called them over and pointed
to the noodle soup.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It came quickly and with
enormous chunks of beef in it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; I pushed them to the side and ate the noodles
and vegetables.&nbsp; My vegetarian hearts
bleeds to tell you that it was quite good.&nbsp;
My frugal heart rejoices that it was 100NT (about 3USD).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
RED HOUSE</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ximending was not precisely what
I expected.&nbsp; It was a mixture of crowded
stores selling things clearly for locals, such as scooter parts and kitchen
supplies, as well as clothes and shoes and the like.&nbsp; But the reason I had really chosen it was for
the Red House (Red Pavilion our guidebook said, but nowhere else did as it
called this).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ximending had tons of maps
posted all over with a compass rose and &#8220;you are here&#8221;.&nbsp; It listed the Red House and we made our way
there, not sure exactly what to look for.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; I stopped our forward
motion.&nbsp; &#8220;Let&#8217;s look at that cool
building for just one second.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took what we thought was a
detour to take a picture of a brick building that looked quite old in a very
commercial district.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81ie0wwwRNo/VZi2zLEVvhI/AAAAAAAAA0Q/bvJTx0bDUqM/s1600/20150630_143209.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81ie0wwwRNo/VZi2zLEVvhI/AAAAAAAAA0Q/bvJTx0bDUqM/s320/20150630_143209.jpg" width="320" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a summer camp full of
children all in neon green that ran up to us happily.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hello!&#8221; Joan called with a big
wave.&nbsp; &#8220;What is this building?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl turned to look at
it.&nbsp; &#8220;This is a very old building,&#8221; she
said, satisfied with her English and smiling to show it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well I can see that,&#8221; Joan said
with a laugh.&nbsp; She continued her
discussion with them, announcing that we were English teachers and asking for a
show of hands of who spoke English.&nbsp; They
all put their hands up, though I wondered who fully understood the question.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children took to her like I took to the building. &nbsp;I saw a sign
and made a beeline for it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Red House,&#8221; it proclaimed in
English.&nbsp; It described the same history
as the &#8220;Red Pavillion&#8221; and I realized that they were one and the same.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Joan!&#8221; I called over to my
companion, but she was in the midst of taking pictures and bonding with the children.&nbsp; &#8220;This is it!&#8221; I called anyway.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made our way into the octagonal
building to a place that was part museum, part café, part gift shop, and all
air conditioned.&nbsp; Most of the building
was still functional, for music performances and the like, so the reading of
the information took only a few minutes, but I marveled at the state of a
1000-year old building, but at the same time, was surprised at its plainness.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
TIEN-HO TEMPLE</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;One of central Taipei&#8217;s most
beautiful Buddhist temples,&#8221; Lonely Planet told me.&nbsp; And it was just next to the Red House.&nbsp; Popsicles in hand, we left the Red House and
walked back towards the intersection.&nbsp; We
didn&#8217;t cross any streets, just walked around a clothing store in the way and into
a very commercial street. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Taipei heat my roselle
popsicle had been reduced to slush before we made it to the street corner.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked farther than we
thought we needed to.&nbsp; And then we walked
some more.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consulted the map that assured
me it was there.&nbsp; Somewhere.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We circled around the back of
the Red House to try again.&nbsp; &#8220;You know,&#8221;
I said to Joan, &#8220;That is a very old building.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Is it now?&#8221; she asked with a
smile.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back at the clothing store we
had circled around before we looked again.&nbsp;
All the way down the road all we could see were shops.&nbsp; Narrow storefronts, like the ones that Lonely
Planet had mentioned, lines the streets crowded closely together, but not a
temple in sight.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman in the clothing store
was not particularly happy to see us, guidebook in hand, obviously about to ask
for directions.&nbsp; &#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said curtly
without a glance in our direction.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S_cVBzHGoZs/VZi305o5bvI/AAAAAAAAA0w/9nA_ZgOcFTw/s1600/20150630_153919.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S_cVBzHGoZs/VZi305o5bvI/AAAAAAAAA0w/9nA_ZgOcFTw/s320/20150630_153919.jpg" width="320" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started to wait, but I really
wasn&#8217;t much good at it.&nbsp; And there was a
group of Taiwanese, probably college aged.&nbsp;
The boy in the group was glancing our way and nonchalantly dancing to
hip-hop music inside the store. &nbsp;&#8220;How did
he make such an action nonchalant?&#8221; you ask.&nbsp;
He didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; But it was clear
nonchalance was what he was going for.&nbsp;
His eyes kept darting in our direction and then looking away whenever we
spoke to one another.&nbsp; The tell-tale sign
that he spoke English.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<o:p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We called the group over who were more than happy to speak to us in English, trying to point out a sign in Chinese that told us where to go. &nbsp;I nodded after saying I didn't see if a dozen times and told him we would find it anyway.</o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving away from the station we
walked on the right side of the street, but still could almost have passed it
by.&nbsp; It was no bigger than one of the
tiny storefronts around it and we wondered if this was it.&nbsp; But walking inward, there wasn&#8217;t any doubt.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O9kvZyR56-U/VZi3sXlfwdI/AAAAAAAAA0g/AbiE-bh7kZQ/s1600/20150630_153730.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O9kvZyR56-U/VZi3sXlfwdI/AAAAAAAAA0g/AbiE-bh7kZQ/s320/20150630_153730.jpg" width="320" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water streamed down into a small
koi pond on one side, a miniature temples built into the rock like they were
cliff faces.&nbsp; A man leaned over the
water, ignoring the statues of an elephant on dragon shooting water, and
looking instead the excited koi churning the water and hoping to be fed.&nbsp; I took a few steps up the stairs toward the
temple and took in the scene of people praying, moving from one spot to the next
in a solemn sort of way. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As people passed I dropped my
head in a meek sort of bow and no one seemed to particularly mind me.&nbsp; But I took in the scene from the outside,
unwilling to stand in the way of something that was so solemn to them.&nbsp; I stood off to the side and looked in, able
to see the back of the temple with the grand golden statues and fruits piled on
a long table.&nbsp; People held their incense
and bowed solemnly, eyes shut tight in thought and prayer.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AxLKF80UpMk/VZi307J5ePI/AAAAAAAAA0s/XhoilGLICag/s1600/20150630_153925.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AxLKF80UpMk/VZi307J5ePI/AAAAAAAAA0s/XhoilGLICag/s320/20150630_153925.jpg" width="320" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The detail of the temple was
beautiful, but the people inside struck me the most.&nbsp; I moved out of the way towards the exit where
I could still see the intricacies of the statues on the building and the people
milling about inside.&nbsp; I could smell the
incense and hear the chanting like music.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admitted that I didn&#8217;t know how
much was appropriate for me to be in the way of or taking pictures of.&nbsp; I felt like an intruder, a voyeur, on
something that was very important and sacred to them.&nbsp; But I felt content just being near it and
hoped that they didn&#8217;t mind me on the outskirts.</div>
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed a few coins in the
beggar&#8217;s hand how stood to meet me as I left.&nbsp;
I hoped, a penance for tromping through their temple and thanks for welcoming me anyway.</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;d
like to say that there weren&#8217;t tears, but there were.&nbsp; Goodbyes to friends and family were
easy.&nbsp; &#8220;Bye, see you next month!&#8221; wasn&#8217;t
too difficult, despite the fact that I don&#8217;t plan to be home for long.&nbsp; But standing outside the airport, my bags
within arms&#8217; reach, looking at my wonderful boyfriend, Owen, who I wouldn&#8217;t see
for six months, I can&#8217;t tell you I didn&#8217;t cry a little.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,
sitting in SFO I&#8217;d realize that that would be my last kiss for a long
time.&nbsp; It suddenly seemed hurried, and I
wished that I had taken just a few more seconds.&nbsp; But by that point they were putting the
important people on our plane and, after two more groups, I would join them.&nbsp; I called
him, though, having only sat on a plane and in an airport, I had nothing new to
say.&nbsp; </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next
came the monotony of an airplane.&nbsp;
Airplanes make me realize how spoiled I am.&nbsp; My personal TV worked for only the length of
two movies and then, when I came back to it hours later, it refused to function
properly.&nbsp; I was irritated.&nbsp; Not because I was hungry and tired and
antsy.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The injustice of having to only entertain
myself with a journal, a blank notepad, a laptop, a cell phone, my Taiwan
Lonely Planet guide, my China phrasebook, and two reading books?! How ever
would I manage?!&nbsp; Truth was, I was too
tired and grumpy to do any of my options.&nbsp;
I was just looking for an excuse to be grumpier.&nbsp; So I put it all away and amused myself
counting down the minutes.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hit
some strong turbulence at about ten or so hours in.&nbsp; I could feel the wide-eyed look my neighbor&#8217;s
face mirrored on my own.&nbsp; But while his expression
must have been one of the normal sort of fear one may feel in such a situation, mine was more annoyance at the thought of how awful it would be to die ten
hours into a twelve and a half hour flight.&nbsp;
If you are going to die on a flight, make it right at the beginning
instead of having to sit uncomfortably for hours upon hours only to meet your
demise.&nbsp; I realized the absurdity of
these thoughts and decided to keep them to myself.&nbsp; Until I posted them publicly on the internet
of course.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

we were closing in on Taiwan.&nbsp; I opened
my window back up and looked over the vast ocean.&nbsp; Of the two runways in TPE, one of them was
closed for construction, so we were forced to circle a few time.&nbsp; I watched ships coming in and out, and, when I
decided to snap a photo of one it turned out to be a forest green ship with &#8220;EVERGREEN&#8221;
written across it.&nbsp; It felt like a
personal welcome to this girl from the Evergreen State.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
ready for Cancun-style immigration.&nbsp; But
immigrations went smoothly and quickly.&nbsp;
The non-residents line was incredibly long but moved at a decent pace,
while the residents line was non-existent, I didn&#8217;t see more than two people
standing together waiting for an immigration officer to be free. In the
non-residents line I stood with Japanese and Chinese and Americans mostly.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certain there were more, as I saw
different colored passports that I hadn&#8217;t seen before.&nbsp; Who has a light purpley passport?! I want
that one!&nbsp; My blue one felt so cold next
to those.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I
looked out for a blue passport in line.&nbsp;
On my paperwork I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should check &#8220;visa-exempt&#8221; or &#8220;landing&#8221;
for my type of visa.&nbsp; I had been told
both and panicked when I realized that I didn&#8217;t know for sure. &nbsp;Certainly a blue passport would know!&nbsp; But everyone of non-Asian decent had their
passports put away in a pocket or something.&nbsp;
I know Asians can also be American, but entering Taiwan I figured more
often than not I would strike out.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan B.
Find the loudest ones in line.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay
for me to say that. I&#8217;m American.&nbsp; Sure
enough, as the line turned a corner, I came directly beside a couple yelling to
one another as though the plane had deafened them.&nbsp; &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; I said, interrupting their
conversation that likely was not going to slow, &#8220;Are you guys US citizens?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
looked at me confused.&nbsp; &#8220;Um&#8230;yeah,&#8221; the
woman finally said.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Great,&#8221;
I flashed them a smile hoping that they would stop making that half-disgusted
face at me. &nbsp;No such luck.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;re visa exempt, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
time the man spoke, but not before a noisy scoff, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Thanks,&#8221;
I turned away from them and checked the correct box on the tiny sheet of paper
and kept my eyes away from the couple each time we passed each other zigzagging
through the line.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
last roadblock between me and my immigration officer was a man standing at the
front of the line, the gatekeeper of immigrations.&nbsp; He was like a bouncer, there only to keep the
various lines from getting too long.&nbsp; But
he took this job very seriously.&nbsp; He
stopped people when he decided that the lines were full enough and then looked
busy pacing this way and that before returning to remind us to continue not
moving.&nbsp; Along with yelling at young
girls not to take selfies, this was all he did.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
Korea I found myself very annoyed when they assumed I spoke no Korean and would
either awkwardly gesture to me or speak in slow, careful English as though I
wouldn&#8217;t understand that either.&nbsp; In
Taiwan, knowing no more than 5 or 6 words, three of which I would use on this
adventure, I was happy when he just gestured with his hand for me to move
forward with a grunt.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Xiexie</i>,&#8221; I thanked him in Chinese, though I am certain it wasn&#8217;t right.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
immigration officer smiled at me and spoke to me in English.&nbsp; &#8220;What are you doing in Taiwan?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Sightseeing,&#8221;
I said, repeating what I had checked on the sheet.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;How
long will you stay?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt
a hesitation before the truth came out, &#8220;About a month.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
raised her eyes to me, &#8220;You have friends here?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
I said with a nod and a smile.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
readied the stamp over my passport, but flipped back to the picture page,
holding it up next to my face.&nbsp; &#8220;Here
this picture looks a little more&#8230;&#8221; she made a motion around her face that
mimicked as though she could have been stroking an invisible beard.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
passport picture looked more what?&nbsp; Did I
look heavier?&nbsp; Younger? Bitchier?&nbsp; All of those could have been quite true as I
was ten pounds heavier and two years younger when I was getting my passport to
go into Korea.&nbsp; And I looked quite a bit
meaner after the man at Walgreens told me not to smile.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe
she couldn&#8217;t find the words to describe it, or she realized it was indeed
me.&nbsp; Either way, she flipped the page
once more and stamped it with my Taiwanese passport stamp.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
retrieved my bags and strolled through out into the lobby of the airport to be
met with men in suits holding signs lined up one after another.&nbsp; I scanned for my name, getting nervous as I
continued on without seeing it.&nbsp; Finally,
with a look of recognition, I saw the sign.&nbsp;
The man in the suit who was holding my name rushed around the remaining
sign holders to meet me, grabbing my bags and greeting me in English.&nbsp; &#8220;Hello, welcome.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t
have time to respond much as he hurried towards the street and then left my
bags with me once more.&nbsp; &#8220;Okay.&nbsp; Five minutes.&nbsp;
You wait here.&nbsp; Because it is very
hot.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Oh&#8230;okay&#8230;&#8221;
I nodded and he hurried out onto the street.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood
exactly where he left me for a long time, much longer than five minutes, when a
security guard came to see if he could help me.&nbsp;
I told him my driver&#8230;er&#8230;my friend was getting a taxi.&nbsp; In actuality I had no idea what he was doing.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay,&#8221;
he motioned for the door.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
watched him leave but was not about to move from the spot where I had been told
he would return for me.&nbsp; Eventually,
after a stampede raced around me, I moved towards the doors in order to be out
of the way.&nbsp; But that seemed worse as
suddenly that was the place to be.&nbsp; I
moved backwards to stand near chairs, but within line of sight to the
door.&nbsp; As I had only gotten a good look
at the back of his head and his suit that looked like every other suit milling
about, I looked down at my phone hoping he would recognize me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he
returned he ushered me to a car and opened the door for me. &#8220;Please,&#8221; he said,
motioning me in. When another man came yelling loudly in Chinese and motioning
wildly, the man in the suit followed his lead.&nbsp;
I stopped to see what the fuss was about and if it had to do with me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Please,&#8221;
he said again, giving me a nudge into the car.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though
I was the one who pulled the door shut behind me, I felt a little ill at ease.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man
who had run up yelling climbed into the driver and sped off onto the highway.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This
is how I&#8217;m taken</i>, I thought to myself, remembering the Liam Neeson movie.&nbsp; <i>If I am not sold into slavery then I&#8217;m going
to get my Master&#8217;s and work for a real school</i>.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owen
had said that the spitting would get to me first.&nbsp; But it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; My driver continually clicked on and off his
brights as he hurried down the freeway.&nbsp;
On. Off.&nbsp; On. Off.&nbsp; Click. Click. Click.&nbsp; Incessantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first thing that got to me.&nbsp; This drew attention to his blatant disregard
for traffic laws and the lines on the road.&nbsp;
This was the second.&nbsp; The third was
his refusal to follow where the GPS told him to go.&nbsp; But I assumed that he must know the way.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
rolled down his window and asked the man next to him something, pointing ahead
of us and then to the right.&nbsp; He was
obviously asking for directions.&nbsp; The
other driver, a man on a scooter, his girlfriend wrapped tightly around his
waist, motioned as well and then sped off.&nbsp;
My driver made a wet noise from the depths of his lungs and spit.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
pulled over and went to talk to someone else, spitting out the window before
walking towards them, spitting again.&nbsp; He
pulled over and spit and then got out to ask a parked taxi something.&nbsp; He spit on his way back.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spitting
got to me fourth.&nbsp; It got to me before
the realization that we were completely lost.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
recognized things from Korea such as Uniqlo and CoCo&#8217;s Curry, and it brought a
smile to my face.&nbsp; But it only solidified
that we had passed that same Uniqlo with a Starbucks attached several
times.&nbsp; I have no idea how long it should
have taken, but it took an hour and a half to find a hotel in the same city as
the airport.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay,&#8221;
he announced parking the car.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t
spit this time so I realized something must be different.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Here?&#8221;
I asked, looking out the window at a restaurant and a bike shop.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t see a hotel.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
laughed and nodded and I got out of the car, not entirely convinced he
understood me.&nbsp; He pulled out my bags and
started around a corner to a small room with a lobby. &nbsp;He spit just before we entered.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two
Chinese women stood behind the counter looking a bit like the comedy and
tragedy masks and greeted us with &#8220;<i>Ni hao</i>&#8221;s that matched their facial
expressions.&nbsp; I offered my &#8220;<i>Ni hao</i>&#8221; as
well, but they didn&#8217;t seem to pay it any mind.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
three seemed to speak at once at, what felt like, quite length.&nbsp; It gave me the feeling that they didn&#8217;t know
what to do with me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Passport,&#8221;
my driver said offhandedly to me before launching back into Chinese with Comedy and Tragedy.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tragedy
stared at my passport for a long time, as though unsure whether or not to take
it as my driver and Comedy continued speaking, their volumes rising.&nbsp; She eventually, tentatively, took it from my
and made a quick photocopy before handing it back to me and turning away once
more.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comedy
was nodding emphatically and picking up the phone to dial a number that my
driver was showing her from his notepad.&nbsp;
She spoke briefly to the person on the other line and then smiled at
me.&nbsp; &#8220;Okay,&#8221; she said, holding the receiver
out to me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay&#8230;&#8221;
I responded, unsure.&nbsp; &#8220;Hello&#8230;?&#8221; I said
into the phone.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
the coordinator at the camp I would be helping with.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ohthankgoodnesss&#8230;&#8221;
escaped from my lips, one word spoken in a single breath.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes.&nbsp; Yes,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;It is good to hear your voice.&nbsp; So this is your hotel.&nbsp; You will live here until the 11<sup>th</sup>.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The 11<sup>th</sup>?!&#8221;&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t have heard him correctly.&nbsp; &#8220;What about orientation?!&#8221;&nbsp; Orientation is where I planned to latch on to
someone to explore Taiwan with while we waited.&nbsp;
I had been told my orientation would be the 30<sup>th</sup> of June and
the 1<sup>st</sup> of July.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Orientation
is the 11<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; We will fetch
you then.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t
know what to say.&nbsp; &#8220;O&#8230;okay&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; There was a long pause.&nbsp; &#8220;Will I be living with someone else&#8230;?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes.&nbsp; Her name is Joanna.&nbsp; She will arrive tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; No, evening.&nbsp;
Almost same flight as you.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay&#8230;&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;If there
is anything else you need I think the women at the front desk speak some
English.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullshit
they did.&nbsp; I needed to gain something
from this conversation.&nbsp; &#8220;The WiFi.&nbsp; The password is in Chinese.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ask
them to translate it for you.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Here,
you do it,&#8221; I passed the phone to Comedy who nodded and spoke a bit more before
placing a mesh pouch with the WiFi password written in numbers along with which WiFi to connect to.&nbsp; I picked up my phone
and snapped a picture.&nbsp; To this both
women laughed but I turned away, ignoring them and waiting for the phone to be
passed back to me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Xiexie</i>,&#8221;
Comedy said before hanging up the phone.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
heart dropped into the depths of my stomach.&nbsp;
Tragedy handed me a room key and pointed to an elevator.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Xiexie</i>&#8230;&#8221;
I said, resolving to make the best of this.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
A man standing at the elevator
greeted me in English and took a look at my room key.&nbsp; &#8220;Floor eleven.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
&#8220;Eleven&#8230;?&#8221; I asked, looking at my
room key that said R681-2.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
&#8220;Yes, yes.&nbsp; Eleven.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
I entered the elevator and pushed
the 11.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
It was quiet except for the sound
of some women cleaning a room.&nbsp; None of
the numbers looked like they could possibly correspond with my room key.&nbsp; I took a few steps in either direction before
retreating back to the elevator and pushing the 6, to go with the 681 on my
room key.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
floor 6 was even emptier.&nbsp; And the man
had said 11.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
returned and walked towards one of the cleaning ladies.&nbsp; I had forgotten "excuse me" in Chinese.&nbsp; Had I ever learned it?&nbsp; &#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221; I said instead.&nbsp; She turned to look and me and took the couple
of paces to close the gap between us.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Nali</i>?&#8221;&nbsp; I asked.&nbsp;
I was fairly certain that was &#8216;where&#8217;.&nbsp;
I knew that if I got the tone wrong it would mean &#8216;over there&#8217;, but I handed
her my key hoping she would understand.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;<i>Nali</i>?&#8221;
she asked, taking the key from me and looking it over.&nbsp; She shook her head and pointed downward.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Down&#8230;?&#8221;
I asked.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I did.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t helpful.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
held her hand up to me in the hang loose symbol.&nbsp; I knew that that meant a number in a way
Americans didn&#8217;t count.&nbsp; I nodded as
though I understood and headed back to the elevator.&nbsp; I stood in the stopped elevator, making the
hang loose sign myself and trying to figure out which number that could
be.&nbsp; I looked at my key again and decided
that it must be 6.&nbsp; I returned to the
sixth floor and walked down the halls until I found a room with my number on
it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
imagined the key not turning and some angry old man in a bathrobe answering the
door and wondering why I was trying to get into his room and yelling at me that
my room was elsewhere, maybe holding up the hang loose sign to indicate where.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9HSLcPhz0i4/VZCN2kAKTcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/XR65GKStbjM/s1600/20150629_054052.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9HSLcPhz0i4/VZCN2kAKTcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/XR65GKStbjM/s320/20150629_054052.jpg" width="320" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
this didn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; The door unlocked
with a loud click and I entered into my hotel room.&nbsp; The first thing I did was connect to the wifi
and make certain my phone would charge.&nbsp;
I didn&#8217;t bring any adapters, had meant to look up if I needed them, but
the drama with my job to come in September distracted me from getting it down.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
phone mercifully connected to the internet a content sort of vibration to
indicate that it had begun charging.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found
the remote to the AC and kept pushing buttons until it turned on, though no
matter how low I turned the temperature it didn&#8217;t get below 27 C, and stayed at
28 more often than not.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took
a cold shower and lathered up with the free soap the hotel provided, too tired
to rummage through for my own.&nbsp; I wrapped
my hair in a towel, but didn&#8217;t put on new clothes.&nbsp; This would be the only night in Taiwan that I
would be alone, so I was going to be as cool as possible.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
swallowed down water from the sink, knowing that in my transit mode, where I
drank little, ate little, and didn&#8217;t go to the bathroom from about noon in SFO
until I arrived in my hotel room fifteen hours later, I was going to dehydrate
myself.&nbsp; I got all the way to my bed
before I realized that I probably wasn&#8217;t supposed to do that and I hoped I
wouldn&#8217;t wake up regretting it.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
window didn&#8217;t overlook anything spectacular.&nbsp;
But as I lay in bed I looked at the drab side of what was either more
hotels or an apartment building, I watched as the neon signs opposite from it
illuminated the wall in shifting colors.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke
up throughout the night to turn the AC back on and to shower twice.&nbsp; I am sure it is something I did wrong with
the AC, but the remote is in Chinese, so on at all is all I can ask for.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read
and fretted over going outside.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t
withdrawn any money as I didn&#8217;t have the time in the airport and had no idea
where an ATM might be.&nbsp; I worry now that
it may not be in English.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the
camp had promised me a food and pocket money allowance.&nbsp; When I asked the coordinator about this he
assured me a pack would arrive in the morning for me.&nbsp; I used this as a reason to wait in my room a
while.&nbsp; I would write a blog post (this
blog post), straighten up the room for my roomie&#8217;s arrival, and brush up on
enough phrases to not starve throughout the day.&nbsp; Then, when the pack came, I would venture out
into the great unknown.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
boiled some water and had a cup of instant coffee and filled my water bottle
back up once the water was cool enough, boiling another pot and sipping on hot
water until the water was cooler, putting that into my water bottle, and returning
for a hot cup once more. I set a trash can beneath the constantly dripping spot
in the ceiling, but later realized there was a hole in the trash can.&nbsp; It is still sitting there though.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what else to do with it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
content with the plan set out before me and accepting the less than ideal
conditions I had started to live in until a knock came to the door.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I small
Chinese woman held out a plastic bag and said &#8220;na&#8221; though I don&#8217;t know in what
tone and I have no idea what it meant.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took
the bag and gave her a confused &#8220;xiexie&#8221;.&nbsp;
Sitting back down at the small desk where I had been writing I opened it
up to reveal a burger and what turned out to be a milk tea.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
was the pack.&nbsp; My food allowance, I realized,
was to be fast food meals brought to my room three times a day.&nbsp; Not only that, but it was a chicken burger
and I had been a mostly vegetarian, cheating in Korea by eating things I dubbed
&#8220;meat adjacent&#8221; or broth if need be.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well,&#8221;
I said, looking down at my breakfast.&nbsp; &#8220;I
had considered eating chicken again&#8230;&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But,
looking at that burger, and thinking of the other &#8220;packs&#8221; that would be brought
to my room, I felt like a zoo animal.&nbsp;
And if I wasn&#8217;t here waiting for it?</div>
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Before
noon,&#8221; the coordinator had said.&nbsp;
Something would be delivered to me before noon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to wait until noon, writing down
all the important directions to find my way back and studying the needed
phrases in the meantime.&nbsp; Then come pack
of pocket money and food allowance, or another meal of fast food, I would set
out to explore Taiwan.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
trying my best to leave my phone behind in the hotel room, we made it to the
airport with minimal drama.&nbsp; The
Villahermosa airport was clean and fast, I guess they forgot to make the rest
of their town nice, and we were off.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
nervous to try to navigate Mexico City.&nbsp;
A new metro that wasn&#8217;t Seoul&#8217;s seemed too much for me to bear!&nbsp; But their easy and well planned metro for 5
pesos was such a relief.&nbsp; Each line is
color-coated and each direction is marked by the end of the line (as none of
them are loops).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had
only been in the city for twenty minutes or so when a woman offered to help us
find our way.&nbsp; Though we understood the
map, we watched as she explained how to get where we needed to be and even
offered to take us there herself (even though she was headed the opposite
direction).&nbsp; We insisted that she needn&#8217;t
do that, but thanked her profusely and, when we parted ways she waved excitedly
and yelled &#8220;Welcome to Mexico!&#8221;&nbsp; A
wonderful first impression of the city.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
other three members of my group were all friends with the couple that offered
to let us stay with them in their home, and so we made our way there in order
to allow our group to, well, regroup.&nbsp;
Since I was not one of the friends, it was admitted to me that my name
was not known and that they had written on the approved guest list the names of
the rest of my group followed by &#8220;y chica&#8221;.&nbsp;
I&#8217;m glad my boyfriend didn&#8217;t know this ahead of time.&nbsp; When this fun fact came to light he exclaimed
&#8220;You mean I could have brought any chica?!&#8221; Too late, dude. &nbsp;Too late.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
first day in Mexico City we took a walk through a beautiful park, Bosque de
Chapultepec in order to get to a history museum within an old castle,
Chapultepec Castle.&nbsp; While Mexico City&#8217;s
climate is far milder than that of our previous destinations, we had arrived on
the sunniest, warmest day in weeks, as our hostess informed us, and the park
was a nice reprieve from the beaming sun.&nbsp;
Vendors sold nuts battered in varying spices and fried, candies that we
familiar such as gummy worms, gummy bears, peach rings, and the like, directly
next to candies I had never seen before.&nbsp;
A popular item was a foam monkey with just enough wire in its frame to
allow it to hold tight to the owner&#8217;s head.&nbsp;
They had boats for rent, and life vests for rent separately, and
certainly no shortage of things to be done including the Anthropology Museum
which we would visit later in our Mexico City adventure.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group
of us entirely and incredibly very white.&nbsp; Even in the
far more mixed-heritage Mexico City we did not look like locals at all.&nbsp; Despite their pale Mid-Western skin and my
paler Pacific Northwestern skin, we had brown hair and maybe could have slipped
through the park with minimal head turns.&nbsp;
This was certainly not a possibility accompanied by our gorgeous, tall,
thin, blonde-haired hostess.&nbsp; Passing a
thick ring of people circling some performing clowns we were called to.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something
about the foreigners.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something
about don&#8217;t we speak Spanish.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something
like &#8220;Oh, no? So sad.&#8221;</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
ring of people laughed out, all eyes on us.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
hostess kept her eyes forward and her walking speed quickened.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What
was that?&#8221; I asked, shooting another look backwards only to find dozens and
dozens of eyes still trained on us.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;They
do that every time,&#8221; she said, clarifying with, &#8220;to the expats.&nbsp; They have nothing better to talk about.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
laughed a bit, but the slightly venomous tone escaping through her somewhat
pursed lips told us that &#8220;every time&#8221; wasn&#8217;t once or twice or even eight or
nine time, but habitually.</div>

castle sits atop a hill, which is wonderful for a view, but less so for
trekking up.&nbsp; We purchases waters and
sports drinks at the bottom of the hill and were told we would need to finish
them before entering the castle.&nbsp;
Misjudging the length of this height, the drinks were guzzled as to
waste no time, which was regretted after walking, and walking, and walking
towards Chapultepec Castle.&nbsp; Maybe that&#8217;s
a bit dramatic.&nbsp; There is a train, or
rather a cart disguised as a train as there are no tracks, that leaves every fifteen
minutes or so, and we walked because it was only a fifteen or so minute
walk.&nbsp; The moral of this rant was more to
warn away from guzzling your delicious sports drink in the first two minutes of
your trek through the unforgiving sun.</div>

Castle was impressive if a bit foreboding.&nbsp;
Its military quality was in stark contrast to the sunny and blue sky
outlined on all sides by the greenery rising from the park.&nbsp; The entryway was painted on the walls and
ceiling with beautiful and haunting paintings and half the rooms were preserved
as they were give an idea of what life was like living there, while the others
were full of history and artwork, often intersecting, explained by various
plaques that were written all in Spanish.&nbsp;
It made me wonder what the latter of the rooms had been used for
previously.&nbsp; But I am sure that there was
some plaque desperately trying to explain it to me.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
the interior of the castle was fantastic, it was stepping out onto the balcony
and garden areas that really made this worth the trek up the hill.&nbsp; All around the castle was the park that
stretched out until it suddenly became city.&nbsp;
Statues and fountains looked marvelous in the beautiful weather we had
somehow been lucky enough to have.&nbsp; It
was simply breathtaking.&nbsp; And hot.&nbsp; It was also hot.&nbsp; I was thinking longingly back to that bottle
of water.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
then, there it was.&nbsp; A water fountain
sitting in a ray of sunshine as though the clouds had parted just to lead me to
it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that actually
happened&#8230;but it feels like it must have.&nbsp;
The rest of the group was talking about something that I couldn&#8217;t focus
on.&nbsp; &#8220;Is this water safe?&#8221; I asked.&nbsp; They continued talking, having not heard me. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took
several more hurried paces towards the water fountain.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s probably fine, right?&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe
they had heard me this time, or maybe they simply noticed the direction of my
beeline.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t trust it,&#8221; one of them said.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Probably
should wait &#8216;til we can get bottled water.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
nodded to myself as though they had said the opposite thing.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s probably fine,&#8221; I agreed with I didn&#8217;t
know who as I came to the water fountain. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
perhaps the fifteenth time that trip all the advice about water and ice and
food flooded back to me.&nbsp; It was the
background noise in my head as I listed to the water streaming from the
fountain.&nbsp; The water was cool and tasted
delicious.&nbsp; And I was fine.&nbsp; Not so much as a stomach cramp or a second
thought.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
returned to the host and hostess&#8217;s house, to the comfort of AC and the promise
of a pool, before we started whipping up some dinner and I tried my very first
sip of mezcal.&nbsp; And holy shit.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Did
you want to try it?&#8221; our host asked me.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
eyes seemed to find me.&nbsp; Obviously I
wanted to try it.&nbsp; I was cool.&nbsp; I could hang.&nbsp;
Sure, give me a glass.&nbsp; I thanked
him and pressed the short glass to my lips.&nbsp;
I did not get any farther than this before my eyes burned a bit.&nbsp; I pulled the glass away blinking and letting
out a &#8220;phew&#8221;.&nbsp; &#8220;Just drink it?&#8221; I
asked.&nbsp; &#8220;Just like this?&#8221;&nbsp; The laughter told me, yes, just like
that.&nbsp; I put the glass to my mouth once
more, moving much faster and taking the worlds tiniest sip before placing the
glass down with another &#8220;phew&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;I guess
now the tequila will seem weak,&#8221; I said.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
checked the bottle quickly to be sure the guys were actually drinking mezcal
and not paint thinner. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stuck
to tequila watered waaaaaay down with soda but was warm and giggly within an
hour anyway.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
guys had all gone to school together.&nbsp;
They had taught in China together.&nbsp;
They had been friends for years and years and had no shortage of stories
to be rehashed upon this reunion. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
laughed along with their stories and contributed mostly when the topic turned
to poking fun at my boyfriend, which is something I can ALWAYS contribute
to.&nbsp; But mostly I just listened and
laughed and shot our hostess looks of <i>I have no clue what they are talking
about.</i>&nbsp; She returned these looks and we
all laughed some more.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day two
in Mexico City began early for me.&nbsp; I
didn&#8217;t sleep past 5am and decided it best to make my way out to the kitchen
instead of disturbing the others, since we all shared the room.&nbsp; I wrote in my journal and sent some messages
to friends while I had wifi and didn&#8217;t see anyone else for a couple of hours.&nbsp; But when they came, they all seemed to come
at once.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
began planning the day, and I suppose they thought I was part of it.&nbsp; They listed place after place, enough that I
couldn&#8217;t keep straight which one someone had vetoed and which everyone had
nodded excitedly to.&nbsp; I simply nodded, hoping
that someone else was just as lost as I was.&nbsp;
But I doubted it.&nbsp; The
Anthropology Museum was the one that stuck in my head.&nbsp; That.&nbsp;
I wanted to do that.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t
fight anyone on anything else so long as we went to the Anthropology
Museum.&nbsp; So the conversation continued
until we finally decided on a plan that I cannot quite recall as none of it
happened.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
walked through a Saturday market that resembled the Saturday markets that I
knew only because they were selling things and it happened to be Saturday.&nbsp; It was more closely related to the market in
Merida without the bugs and grime.&nbsp; There
were mechanical parts to something or other and whisks and silverware and
things a tourist would never consider buying, but it was interesting to feel
part of the real life of Mexico City.&nbsp; I
lingered like a distracted child, but my boyfriend kept me up to a decent pace,
pulling me by the hand as I slowed to watch a woman haggle over the price of a
strainer.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impressive
architecture rose up all around us as we moved out of the ritzier part of
Mexico City that was home to Gucci stores and embassies alike. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What
is that?!&#8221; I would ask, pointing to the most amazing building I had ever seen.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;A
bank,&#8221; our host or hostess would say, disinterested.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Wow&#8230;&#8221;
I would linger, amazed, until my eye caught the NEXT most amazing building I
had ever seen. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
occurs to me now this may be called existing in a city.&nbsp; Maybe this is what most banks look like in
big cities and simply in being different from Seattle or Portland or Seoul
everything seemed new and exciting.&nbsp;
Maybe after having traveled more I too will be able to pass archways and
spectacular facades with a simple &#8220;just another bank&#8221; or &#8220;that&#8217;s only a mall&#8221;
or maybe I won&#8217;t even notice it because it will all seem commonplace.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I
hope not.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

passing banks was impressive, I simply was not prepared for the post
office.&nbsp; This post office was plated in
gold.&nbsp; This seems like an unlikely
sentence, and, believe me, it is an even more unlikely sight.&nbsp; &#8220;<i>This</i> is the post office?!&#8221; I asked staring
up at the elevator that was shimmering in the light of the chandelier
overhead.&nbsp; Never had I wanted to have my
picture taken with a post office so badly.&nbsp;
Brush Prairie&#8217;s post office doesn&#8217;t even have more than one employee as
far as I know.&nbsp; There was a section, not
just a corner, dedicated to art and post office related history and I started
that way before I was reminded that we had other things to see.&nbsp; My strong desire to spend an hour in just the
post office told me that two days in Mexico City was ridiculous.&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp;
It wouldn&#8217;t be enough.&nbsp; And
begrudgingly I left back out to the street only to see another most impressive
building I had ever seen.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We
moved on to the Zocalo, a square that was surrounded on all side by points of
interest highlighted in our guidebooks.&nbsp;
The stop we had intended to start with was the Palacio Nacional.&nbsp; It is one of the places that you must visit
while in Mexico City!&nbsp; Or so I was
told.&nbsp; The outside was very nice.&nbsp; But it was also closed.&nbsp; This caught us off guard and our group just
kind of stared at it a while willing it to be open so that our plans could
continue on.&nbsp; But eventually we gave this
up and turned to our left to the Catedral Metropolitana.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

cathedral has varying architectural styles as it has been built upon all
throughout the colonial period and, through glass in the ground, you can look
down onto some of the ruins of Templo Mayor that it had been built upon.&nbsp; This, more than the guidebooks or
documentaries had, conveyed a feeling of the history of the city.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
inside was full of people worshiping.&nbsp; I
felt like a voyeur as I admired the altars and artwork in the midst of people
trying to have a religious experience.&nbsp; I
appreciated the beauty and history of cathedral, but not without a feeling of
guilt.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know they would allow heathens like me in here!&#8221; one of the members of
our group, a Methodist, joked.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just
scoffed and continued walking about. &nbsp;<i>Try being Asatru,</i>&nbsp;I thought to myself, avoiding walking under
chandeliers just in case.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
moved to Templo Mayor next.&nbsp; I wanted so
badly to be awed&nbsp; by what was left of
this structure.&nbsp; But I simply wasn&#8217;t.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Look
at what it used to look like!&#8221; the recreations of the Templo Mayor seemed to
cry to us.&nbsp; &#8220;Look how amazing it <i>was</i>!&#8221;&nbsp; This is not to say you ought not to go.&nbsp; It is only a couple dollars to check it
out.&nbsp; And maybe your imagination will
allow you to fill in some of the blanks.&nbsp;
But for me, &#8220;It used to take up so much more space!&nbsp; See that coffee shop over there?&nbsp; That was built over the ruins of this,&#8221; wasn't enough. &nbsp;It just fell short of the ruins we had
already seen.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Nah,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone feels like it.&#8221;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could
feel despair nestle itself into my heart.&nbsp;
If that sounds dramatic, well, it was a dramatic time in my life!&nbsp; I had stared at those stupid rocks that
someone insisted was a temple for far too long.&nbsp;
I had been pulled from my post office.&nbsp;
And now the new plan was brunch and then coffee shops in &#8220;a kind of cool
neighborhood&#8221;?&nbsp; I swallowed down a
tantrum remembering I was a 24 year old woman and simply continued to pout. &nbsp;I felt that was a reasonable middle ground
between tears and kicking my legs and going with the flow.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I
know I should have simply gone with the flow.&nbsp;
My boyfriend suggested we split up after brunch and some of us go to the
&#8220;kind of cool neighborhood&#8221; and he and I, and anyone else who was interested
(which turned out to be no one) go to the Anthropology Museum.&nbsp; Everyone said that was fine, but I suddenly
felt guilty for my childlike pouting.&nbsp; I
told him it was fine, that we could all stay together, but he insisted that he
also wanted to go the museum.&nbsp; I knew he
didn&#8217;t really.&nbsp; That he would have
preferred to go with his friends, that really he was just going for me.</div>

brunch is what some of us like to call &#8220;lunch&#8221;.&nbsp;
It happened at around 1pm, and served lunch-type food.&nbsp; But because we called it &#8220;brunch&#8221;, I decided
that it was fine to start drinking.&nbsp; I
ordered in Spanish, which I should not be too proud of since I simply said
&#8220;para mi&#8230;&#8221; the food I wanted, and, &#8220;y&#8230;&#8221; the drink I wanted.&nbsp; And even that I had to do twice and point to
the menu because my pronunciation is apparently shit.&nbsp; While the food was great, it came at Mexico
speed.&nbsp; We waited for what felt like
hours (it wasn&#8217;t) and were starving by the time our food came.&nbsp; I ordered a second drink knowing that it
would take forever and someone else ordered a coke.&nbsp; By the time the second drink came everyone
had finished their food and had been hoping for the check for ages.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even want that beautiful, delicious
drink at that point, and the coke was shoved in a bag &#8220;for later&#8221;.&nbsp; I angrily and quickly drank that beautiful
and expensive drink, which is not the ideal fashion to drink such a drink, and
the check came within minutes.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite
the guilt of pulling my boyfriend from his friends&#8230;I really, really enjoyed the
Anthropology Museum.&nbsp; There were a series
of rooms for each civilization.&nbsp; Even
though we had three hours, we had been warned to pick and choose which we
wanted to see most and not lollygag too much. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within
each room there were some real artifacts and some reproduction, but the
recreations were done so well the only real way to tell them apart it seemed
was either by being informed by one of the signs or deducing that, because this
one was behind thick glass and surrounded by protective rope and that one was
within arms&#8217; reach, that this one must be real and that one a reproduction.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
museum was exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; The
ruins we had seen had provided a skeleton of the civilizations that had once
inhabited Mexico and the museum had filled in the flesh and blood: the religion
and daily life.&nbsp; The clothing they wore
and the products they created.&nbsp; What they
might have eaten and the stories they probably told. </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each section
was broken into an upstairs (with the aforementioned artifacts and such), an
outside (the was a smell section recreated into life-size), and an upstairs.&nbsp; For the most part, the upstairs areas were a
mystery to me.&nbsp; We had only three hours
(yes, I said only three.&nbsp; Three is
nowhere near enough) and we only say the upstairs to one of them.&nbsp; But it was recreated with photos and
color.&nbsp; It made me wish I had seen the
other upstairs sections.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We both
left very happy that we had gone, which made me feel slightly less guilty about
my earlier pouting.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
would leave the next morning and so, to celebrate our second but final night in
Mexico City, we all drank margaritas the size of our heads.</div>
