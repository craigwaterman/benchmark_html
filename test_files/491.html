		<p>Presenting my first ever but at the same time lifetime vision board!!<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://chasingafterdandelions.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_0641.jpeg"><img src="https://chasingafterdandelions.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_0641.jpeg?w=656" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
I never really planned to make a vision board for my life. I usually have my plans for the future in my head, trying to imagine who I would become some few years from now. Or sometimes, I would draw a timeline in a random notebook (usually a short-term timeline). But I never really put serious effort into it.</p>
<p>However, by mid-January, I happened to see a post from one of my favorite motivational speakers and authors (Bo Sanchez) of the vision boards he and his sons made for 2016. And I thought that making one is a good idea. But rather than making a vision board for 2016 and every year thereafter, I decided to make a lifetime vision board!</p>
<p>It took me quite some time to conceptualize how I would want my vision board to look like. I wanted it to be simple yet meaningful. And I wanted the pictures to be downloaded and printed out so that I could choose better, rather than getting them from magazines (I am not good in drawing so it was never an option. Hahaha!).</p>
<p>I started by the 3rd week of January and just finished it yesterday. I only had the weekends to work on it so it took quite some time (but I felt like a student again doing some sort of art project). The moment I placed the last picture, I felt so happy by simply looking at the piece of work done. Even though they were just mere pictures and no dream has been accomplished yet, I felt fulfilled by seeing the pictures that depict the kind of future I want to have until my last breath.</p>
<p>I would display this in my room and look at it everytime I feel discouraged. You can try making one too. I guarantee that it will make you feel that you are going to live a life full of excitement and purpose! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Time check: 12:52AM (as I start this entry)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was not supposed to come home tonight due to the heavy traffic earlier (typical payday Friday scenario). But I had some officemates who were on their way to their hometowns, and so I decided to go home as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now, I sit on my bed feeling tired from the past workweek. But I just really want to make a post before all my thoughts and feelings go away. If ever there would be a lot of grammatical errors in this entry, please bear with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actually, just last night, I was planning to make a blog post which started with the sentence “I never felt so stuck in my life.” and with the title “Quarter-Life Crisis”. But I was simply too tired to push through with it (a whole lot more tired than I am right now). I felt so lost and with no purpose before finally falling asleep. I thought that the so-called quarter-life crisis was just some sort of drama from people my age, and I even saw it as a cliché because of countless online articles about being twenty-somethings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But apparently, quarter-life crisis does exist. And I was no exception to experiencing it. I now understand how it really feels. It gave me that kind of heavy feeling of having no purpose, that everything seems to become so routinary. You wake up, then get ready for work, then report to work and do the tasks at hand, then go home, then sleep, then wake up the next day, then get ready for work, and then it goes on and on and on. Of course, there is also eating in between and some random activities at times. But you get what I mean. Working life becomes routinary at some point and then somehow, you get bored. Add to it the fact that you know there is a wide variety of options out there and opportunities that seem more exciting than what you are doing and where you are right now. But you are doing nothing, because you do not know what to choose or where to go or what you really want to achieve in life in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was how confused I felt. Even before, I had these kinds of emotions but was able to brush them off and continue with my daily rountine. But for some weird reasons, it really sank deep yesterday. And I was not feeling good about it anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This morning while taking a shower, I still had that heavy feeling from last night of having no purpose. Surprisingly though, all these negative feelings changed while I was still in the shower! It was like a light bulb moment! Does it mean I already found my life’s purpose? No. But I somehow had an idea about what I wanted to do. I was able to sort things out and even came up with a short timeline (no wonder why I took 30 minutes in the shower and almost got late for work).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how did my feelings make a sudden turnaround? My answer is simple: I PRAYED. I was talking to God while taking a bath &#8211; telling Him how I felt, how lost and how stuck I was (or so I think), how I was losing direction of where I wanted to go. While praying, memories from the past came flashing back. And then I realized that even before, I was always excited with the idea of land development.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moment I resigned from my first job, I sent out applications to various real estate companies. I was applying for positions related to project developments because I liked the idea of using space to improve one’s surroundings. Maybe this is partly due to the influence from my parents who happens to be both engineers and from my sister who is an architect. I liked the idea of developing a place. However, despite the applications I sent to almost all well-known real estate companies in the country, not even one was interested in me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And so I decided to drop the idea of working in a real estate company and to try out others until I was hired by Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc. And honestly, I have no regrets of choosing Coca-Cola because aside from it being a multi-national company and belonging to the fast-moving consumer goods (a.k.a FMCG) industry, I do have a great boss who is one of my best mentors as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then, remembering my original plan of trying out land development suddenly ignited &nbsp;the spark within me once again. And so, I started to make a timeline (in my head while still in the shower :p). I have no plans of resigning yet in my current job. In fact, I am planning to stay for another 2 to 3 years at most, unless circumstances change my decisions. But I do have plans of transferring to another department within the year and hopefully, with a promoted position. Yes, it may be very rare to have a boss like mine. But in the end, nothing is permanent. I admit that my current boss is my comfort zone right now. But I will always try to step into my courage zone. Also, upon transferring to another department, I would choose one that involves creativity (I am currently under Finance which, as you know and as obvious as it is, ALWAYS involves numbers). I already have two departments in mind but let me reserve that to myself first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After gaining enough experience in handling creative projects in CCFPI, I would try to apply in a well-known real estate company ONCE AGAIN, and be involved heavily in large-scale land&nbsp;development projects. But if my application fails the second time around, that is when I would think of my next step. Maybe land development would not be my calling by then. But it is too early to say such since I am still two to three years away from those goals. I know that a lot may change within that timeframe. At least now, I feel more enlightened than I was previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is all thanks to my prayer moment during shower that I was able to think thoroughly about my timeline and about what I really want to try out in life. And so, I prefer to call it the quarter-life challenge rather than a crisis because quarter-life is a stage that you must not just simply wait to let it pass in order to become or feel better. It is a stage that you must take as a challenge and at the same time, enjoy that challenge along the way. I would always like to bear in mind that the journey is as important as the destination. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>

		<p>Whenever I saw pictures of people wearing corporate attires, I always thought &#8220;They seem to be living boring lives.&#8221; There was a time when I was still a kid, while we were on the road, I saw a billboard of a lady in a blazer and pencil cut skirt paired with high heels. I told my dad, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to wear clothes like that when I grow up.&#8221;.</p>
<p>A few more years later and voila!! Here I am in corporate attires and spending 10 hours a day in the office on the average. I did not think that one day, I too, would belong to the so-called &#8220;corporate world&#8221;.</p>
<p>The moment I chose Business Administration and Accountacy as my course, I knew that my path was leading towards the professional world. During my latter years in college, we had numerous case presentations in which we were required to report in corpo attires. I remember that the first time I bought my own black pencil cut skirt (which I still use), I said to myself &#8220;Seems like I&#8217;m beginning to invest in corporate attires.&#8221; And true enough, as soon as I got my professional license, I started shopping for blouses, skirts and dresses (back in college, I always wore shirts and jeans. So just imagine my wardrobe makeover as soon as I started working!).</p>
<p>Honestly, I was somehow afraid of the corporate world before I started being a member of it. Here is why.</p>
<p>Both my parents started a business when I was still young so they rarely told me stories about working in an office with a boss. My only exposure to the corporate world was through movies and series I watched.</p>
<p>And there were two things I usually noticed from the shows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Employees being scolded by the notorious boss in front of everybody in the office</li>
<li>Employees seriously working behind their desks like robots and as if lunch time is their only happy hour</li>
</ol>
<p>So it developed in my mind that bosses were scary, hot-headed and boastful. Also, it was as if working in the office meant being glued to your chair and being imprisoned in your workstation until it&#8217;s finally the end of the day.</p>
<p>Two years into the corporate world and my connotation of it has changed. I have been lucky enough to be handled by managers who knew how to apply the concept of anger management. I have made mistakes in work (which is normal) but was never shouted upon in front of my colleagues. Of course, I had heard stories from others about bosses shouting and even throwing working papers at them. But good for me, I haven&#8217;t been through such (and would not want to experience having a boss like that).</p>
<p>Also, in my job (and even in my previous one), I was not glued to my workstation. I have time to roam around the office, observe what others are doing, and bond with colleagues. We even get to have some small chitchats about random stuff. But I guess this kind of freedom depends on the type of office environment one has. Maybe there are really employers who are strict and needs total silence during office hours.</p>
<p>In the end, I realized that the corporate world is not as scary and as boring as I thought before. And corporate attires can also be fun to wear after all! It makes me feel presentable.</p>
<p>Yes, I assure you that it is a competitive environment because of the so-called &#8220;corporate ladder&#8221; where employees do their very best to get promoted. But in the end, it&#8217;s really your choice as to how much amount of stress you are willing to give into the corporate world and how career-driven you are as an individual.</p>
<p>As for me, I know I have my own personal goals and pacing. I always choose to be happy and kind, and to make an impact that would somehow help this world become a better place.</p>

		<p>I was the shy type of kid. I did not like crowds that much and I was often quiet in class. In fact, back in elementary and high school, I was often awarded as &#8220;Intrapersonal&#8221;, meaning someone who would rather work alone rather than in groups. Was this true? Actually no. I liked working in groups. It&#8217;s just that there were times I could not count on my groupmates anymore and had to finish it myself.</p>
<p>In some parties, groups of teens would form and I would be told to go over that table. That was no big deal for me actually, if only I was not &#8220;out of place&#8221;. Most of the times, I could not relate to what they were talking about. Since they were already close to each other, they had a lot of things in common. I usually just sat there and listen.</p>
<p>People often tell me I never really talk too much. I must admit that it was actually true especially during high school. So as soon as I entered college, I made it a point that I would interact more with people, getting to know more as much as possible.</p>
<p>In UP, to survive every subject especially non-majors, you need to learn how to interact with different types of people. You get the chance to be classmates with all sorts &#8211; from freshies to seniors, from engineering to fine arts to biology students, from normal ones to weird (but mostly cool) kids. So you can just imagine how hard it was for me to adjust during my freshman days. A young girl from a Catholic school in the province came all the way to the metro to study in a university where there was so much freedom of expression. There were rules of course, but the students always had a choice (you just have to suffer the consequences of your choices). And that is what I loved about UP.</p>
<p>It is all thanks to the challenges I faced in my university and also thanks to the best group of friends I had during those days, the girl who was once tagged as &#8220;too quiet&#8221; is now someone who could stir up a meaningful conversation.<br />
I admit that I am still more of the listener rather than the speaker. But now, I am more confident with various groups of people. Put me in a group of young professionals and I will find a common ground for a topic. Put me in a group of music fanatics and I will find a common ground for a topic. Put me in a group of religious people and I will find a common ground for a topic. Put me in a group of girls with blooming love lives and I would gladly listen to their love stories. Hahaha! (Just wait for my love story. I know it will be great to share it someday!)</p>
<p>No one forced me to get out of my shell. I decided it on my own as soon as I grew older. When I was young, I was usually forced by the people around me, telling me to stay on this table and talk to these people. Or go to this place and find new friends. Or to go out, explore, and see the world! These things were somehow pushed to me when I was young&#8230;and I did not like that kind of pressure. But when I became more matured, I decided to be more outgoing on my own. No one forced me to learn how to deal with other people. It was something I learned and actually enjoyed doing myself.</p>
<p>I would just like to point out that you can&#8217;t force someone to be an extrovert if she is an introvert. Don&#8217;t criticize her just because she chooses to be quiet and simply listen to conversations. Don&#8217;t make her feel like she doesn&#8217;t belong just because she is not used to the &#8220;loud crowd&#8221;. Let her discover herself. Let her explore her personality. Let her witness what she is actually capable of and support her for that. In the end, you might be surprised. She might turn out to be more outgoing and more fun as a companion than someone who was originally a member of the &#8220;loud crowd&#8221;.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">With a new year usually comes a resolution. Allow me to join the bandwagon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my previous blog, I described how my 2015 went. And with all my experiences from the past year, there are things I learned which must be applied moving forward. Below are the major reminders for myself in 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Don&#8217;t force things to happen</li>
</ul>
<p>Because they will happen eventually, if it is already the right time or if it is meant to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Value those who value you</li>
</ul>
<p>And let go of those who take your presence for granted. Spend more time with people who genuinely treasures you and gives importance to your presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>Because in the end, you cannot please everybody. You do not have to conform to the norm. Embrace your own YOUniqueness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept the things you cannot change and have the courage to change the things you can</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Enough said, no explanation needed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With that, I will continue to chase after my dandelions this 2016. I will never stop until I finally get a hold of the dreams I have always wanted to achieve. Cheers to a better and more epic 2016!!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">2015 has been my most spontaneous year so far. There had been a lot of unexpected turn of events &#8211; some were bitter and painful, but mostly were pleasant surprises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had 3 jobs this year. I resigned from my first job last January and started a new one a week after. But just a month after I started my second job, a reorganization was announced and my position was declared redundated (this twist of fate turned out to be a blessing due to a higher salary and a better exposure in work). Those included in the separation were given priority upon applying for a position in the parent company. A month after the reorganization, I got accepted in the parent company and started my third job right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To date, I have been working in Coca-Cola FEMSA Phils., Inc. for more than 9 months. And I have no plans of resigning just yet because the work environment is better and more balanced compared to my first job (more details of my experience in SGV &amp; Co. next time).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aside from having 3 jobs, I also lived in 3 dormitories. The first was near my first job. But as soon as I resigned, I transferred to a dorm closer to my current job. However, despite the expensive monthly rate, the facilities were not worth it (no TV, no wifi, no aircon, not so nice maintenance, etc.) So me and my roommate, who is also my officemate and college friend, decided to look for another dorm. Luckily, we found a better and cheaper one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are currently six in the room and it is actually my first time to be roommates with strangers. But apparently, they are nice to talk to and I also gained new friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also tried A LOT of new things this year. I travelled to various places, most of which were unplanned. This is actually not so me. I hated unplanned trips back in college, and usually made a pass whenever there was one. But now, I find it exciting. And the thought of being spontaneous and going to unplanned trips gives me the thrill.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To enumerate every event and every place I went to this year would make this blog a really long one. So below is a list of some of the unexpected but most memorable ones I went to.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Pentatonix Concert in Araneta Coliseum: In 2014, I became a fan of the a-cappella group Pentatonix. I just really love their style and technique, and listening to their songs made me relax. Around May, my friend told me that the group would be having a concert in the Philippines by June. Luckily, a few tickets were still available even though the concert was only a month away. And so, we were able to watch them live!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Hong Kong-Macau: Last August, for the first time, I travelled with my college friends out of the country becuase of a promo fare we availed of during March. I usually travel with my family, but travelling out of the country with friends is pretty epic! And I want to do this again soon!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Love Life Retreat in Batulao, Batangas: I never really planned to attend a retreat again after my first one around seven years ago during my graduating year in high school. But come September, I was invited by my church community to attend the batch 12 of Love Life Retreat. Those who went were mostly people I did not know which, again, is not so me because I don&#8217;t like attending events without a close friend. But after the retreat, I felt better and it was a great experience meeting new people and hearing their stories.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">National Museum: I am not a fan of historical paintings and sculptures (more of a music fan here). But a friend invited me to come with them to the National Museum last October because the entrance was free. And since I haven&#8217;t been there, I thought &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221;. Seeing the actual paintings made by famous Filipino painters and sculptors I read from our historical books took my breathe away (especially Spoliarium by Juan Luna).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Year-End Inventory Count in Davao City: Just this December, it was my very first time to travel to Mindanao. In fact, it was my very first time to travel outside Luzon. And it was decided only 2 days before the actual flight! It&#8217;s a long story as to how I was chosen to be sent there. Anyway, it was a business trip but we had one day to tour around. I was blessed to go there because I learned a lot from the locals (aside from the learnings from work, of course). They were really kind and I like the way they treat other people.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the trips and events which were somehow expected/planned include our family&#8217;s summer outing in Hundred Islands last April, The Script concert in MOA Arena also last April (this was totally a dream come true!!), swimming in Camaya Coast last May, finance team building in Batangas this December, and bondings with friends throughout the year.<br />
Honestly, 2015 has been a blast for me. It is one of the most memorable years of my life so far. It somehow changed me as a person &#8211; the way I view life and the way I understand circumstances. I witnessed both the bitter and sweet realities of life, based on my own experiences and based on hearing the experiences of others. This is the year I met various types of people, and made a couple of new friends as well. I learned a lot by talking to them and listening to what they have to share.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I realized that there are things that is just really beyond my control no matter how hard I try, that there are people who are blessed but are ungrateful and yet there are those who are the exact opposite, and that there are things not given at once even though it seems I already deserve it. Life is unfair&#8230;but it is still beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had set my own goals at the start of 2015. And now that it is about to end, there were dreams fulfilled and dreams not fulfilled (yet). But I know that there is a right time for everything. And this year, everything happened at its own perfect timing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven. &#8211; <b>Ecclesiastes 3:1</b> </i></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I formally start my entry, let me warn you that this post is more of a personal one. I would not blame you if you get bored or find it too dramatic. But this would be coming from the depths of my heart, and I would want to express how I feel with all honesty. I don&#8217;t usually share this kind of topic in an article that might be read by a couple of strangers. But that is the point of all this anyway. You don&#8217;t know me personally (perhaps), and I would not lose anything by being open about my feelings. Besides, you might relate to it as well. This may be a long one. And so I begin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges in life is to wait for a dream to come true with the uncertainty of when it would happen or if it would actually ever happen. There are simply things in life which we have no complete control of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We all have moments when we are in the process of waiting &#8211; waiting for a promotion, waiting for a baby, waiting to get healthier, or simply waiting in line. Here, let me share my waiting process of meeting the right person (romantically speaking).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recently, it has been a struggle for me to meet &#8220;the one&#8221;. I don&#8217;t usually force things to happen. In fact, in my younger days, I liked (and believed) in the idea of destiny &#8211; of events naturally happening and falling into place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was in high school, despite admirers, I was firm not to enter into a romantic relationship. I felt that I was still too young back then and that when I have a boyfriend, I want him to be my first and last (talk about idealistic). And so, I chose to focus on my studies. Besides, it was my ultimate dream to enter the top university in our country (which did come true so my efforts were not wasted).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as I entered university, I was pretty sure that I was matured enough to handle a relationship. However, due to the immense difficulty of my course, I still had to focus on my studies. I was an average student and really had to study extra hard to pass my subjects and graduate on time. As much as I wanted to have time for a love life, I chose to prioritize academics and a bit of extra-curricular activities. I believed that if I was meant to fall in love, it would happen. And since it did not do so during my college days, I thought &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not yet the right time.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as soon as I started working, I became unsure if there is really such a thing called destiny.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Despite me being single ever since does not mean that I don&#8217;t know anything about love. In fact, I have had my own taste of pain in falling in love, of trying to make things work out, and of finally moving on. It&#8217;s just not the type of pain that normally exists in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. But it&#8217;s the kind of pain that snatches away my dream of a fairy-tale like love story as time goes by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I experienced the kind of attraction that no matter how much I wanted the guy to reciprocate my feelings, he just could not keep up with the level of interest I have for him. He only saw me as a good friend. In short, unrequited love on my end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I exprienced being courted by a guy whom I just saw as a good friend. And that no matter how I looked at it, I just felt that he wasn&#8217;t the one for me, and that we would be better off as friends. In short, unrequited love on his end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I experienced being a rebound girl, but did not fall into that trap (though I admit it still hurt my pride as a girl).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I experienced giving way for a friend who also liked the same guy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the most recent, I experienced falling for someone whom I did not find interesting at first. But due to sudden turn of circumstances, it resulted to me actually falling for him. And worse, admitting my feelings right in front of him (which I never did before in my entire life).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After all these experiences, with each having a unique story behind it, I grew tired of the type of love that never fell into place, the type of love that never seemed to make sense. It&#8217;s either I like the guy but he doesn&#8217;t like me, or the guy likes me but I don&#8217;t like him, or we both like each other but really just not meant to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the onset of 2015, I felt positive that it is the year when my love life would finally make sense, that all this waiting would finally come to an end. I somehow felt sure that I would finally meet &#8220;the one&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But 15 days before a change in calendar and I still have no idea who he is. Honestly, I never felt this frustrated before. The longer my prayers go unanswered, the more frustrated I get. The more frustrated I get, the more I begin to doubt. And the more I doubt, the more I lose hope to believe in such a thing called &#8220;destiny&#8221; and &#8220;right timing&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like I said earlier, I don&#8217;t like to force things to happen. I don&#8217;t want to go desperately searching for him (which I honestly did try to do before due to frustration). And I don&#8217;t believe in love at first sight. Attraction at first sight? Yes. But love? Definitely not. My dream love story is that we both start out as friends, with no malice or expectations from each other. Eventually, we would realize that we make a good pair. And then until the guy would start sweeping me off my feet with his hopeless romantic gestures. But with all that I have been through, I don&#8217;t even know if such a thing still exists in the present. Or am I just really an illusionary girl?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I see a lot of couples and I am surrounded by a lot as well (especially at this age). And I admit that I do feel envious most of the times whenever I see a girl with her man beside her &#8211; as if always ready to protect her no matter what, as if always there for her during both happy and sad times, as if nothing in this world could stop them from falling in love with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I may look strong and independent on the outside as if I can always handle things on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I may be emitting the aura of sunshine, of green grass and soft breeze, of swaying flowers and clear blue skies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the end, I&#8217;m still a girl. Fragile. Physically weak. Someone who needs a sword and shield during the war. Someone who needs an umbrella during the storm. Someone who needs a blanket during the cold days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Deep inside, I am also hurting. And sometimes, I do get tired of waiting&#8230;and waiting&#8230;and waiting&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the end, I still choose to wait&#8230;and believe that he exists.</p>
