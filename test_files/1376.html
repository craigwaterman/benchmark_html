The photo here is not from that trip, but in a similar way, I played some of my songs for the other satsangis at the outdoor langar (free kitchen). It was very nice to have even the most cryptic of my lyrics understood and appreciated.</p>
<p>I told a few about how I had traveled to Bangalore last winter and met Baba Ram Singh Ji―spent two weeks meditating and attending His satsangs―how jolly and beautiful and how full of authority He was. How to tell people about Him without proselytizing? haven&#8217;t quite figured it out. But here it is, almost a year later and I&#8217;m still under His charm.</p>
<p><b>Under the Charm<br />
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>I can see my desires rising up so clearly<br />
I can feel my loss; falling down so dearly<br />
the gift of love, again, missed so nearly<br />
It seems that life is a game that no one can win<br />
It’s all arranged so cleverly and queerly</p>
<p><i>Are we born to live?<br />
Or are we born to die?<br />
Some say we can choose our view<br />
yet both the young and the old<br />
still wonder why<br />
and neither know what to do.<br />
Whether we look at the earth<br />
or look beyond the sky<br />
none of it, real or true</i></p>
<p>Then You come with Your revealing story<br />
with Your mystic love and Your graceful glory<br />
into the world for some time<br />
of all things forgotten, You remind</p>
<p>Then all our weary old hearts are breaking<br />
with Your every familiar glance<br />
Then the very earth begins shaking<br />
just like our trembling hands<br />
Then the pains of all the ages aching<br />
pour forth at such a chance<br />
All relatives and dreams of relatives we are forsaking<br />
as You walk upon these ancient and bitter lands<br />
Then, no more plans are we making<br />
under the charm of this romance</p>
<p>But, what of our failures; what of our crimes<br />
Every moment our guilt is exposed in these hard times<br />
You say, “Judge not!” but all we do is judge<br />
We wipe the mirror, but we only make a smudge<br />
My friends say, “Jesse, don’t take it so seriously, man!”<br />
My answer is that we all do what we can.</p>
<p>Then You come and Sweet Justice falters<br />
goes out the back door with his chains and his altars<br />
with his curse of impending doom<br />
and now, at last, we can breathe in this room</p>
<p>Now the timid day dreamers are free to make friends<br />
Now the desperate self-defeaters can make our amends<br />
We lowly floor cleaners will stand as women and men<br />
Even these of ghostly poor demeanor may come forth again.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Wow, I published this without a title. If forgetfulness was the goal, I&#8217;d probably be quite successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As stated in a previous post, my upcoming memoir and my upcoming collection of song lyrics and poetry is now an upcoming work of the two as one.<br />
So, in this post I&#8217;ve included both a song lyric and a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The lyric is full of the gloom of winter. It has a pretty and melancholy little finger picking melody which carries it along I think. I hope readers will be able to appreciate it standing alone here.<br />
Yet it doesn&#8217;t entirely stand alone, as the poem is a hopeful one of a spiritual Springtime.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As always, I really appreciate your coming by to read. Please leave a comment if your so inclined.     Namaste, jesse</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">p.s. The photo is from Seattle in my street musician days, back in the 70&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p align="center"><b>Winter<br />
</b>(a song lyric)</p>
<p>Every day I have to come back<br />
Every day I have to bring myself back<br />
from this love or some other<br />
from my cold-hearted brother<br />
<i>the untrue friend</i></p>
<p>We spend these years together<br />
We search for God and then He finds us<br />
Yet now you write and call me never<br />
You fill the empty miles on this crowded bus<br />
with all this nothing to discuss<br />
fair weather, fair weather</p>
<p>Every day I have to wake up<br />
Every day I have to shake myself up<br />
from this love or the last<br />
from all daydreams of the past<br />
<i>      the faithless lover</i></p>
<p>With the innocence of the intimate<br />
in the spring we planted a child<br />
In expectation of the benefit<br />
we believe that nature has smiled<br />
but your heart is never reconciled<br />
and that will mean the end of it.</p>
<p>Every day I have to come clean<br />
Every day I must admit what I’ve seen<br />
of this love and all the rest<br />
No love can pass the test<br />
<i>     the false God</i></p>
<p>creates the hope that lasts so long<br />
as we dance by the midnight oil<br />
as we sing the traveler’s song<br />
where in the garden of  love we toil<br />
where we grow like dreams in the fertile soil<br />
until the winter comes along</p>
<p>Every day I have to write a verse<br />
Every day I have to fight the curse<br />
of this lie and every one<br />
for the truth that must begun<br />
<i>      for the only one</i></p>
<p>Only the hopeless have reason to hope<br />
Only the lost can be found<br />
When finally we come to the end of our rope<br />
at the end of the world there is a sound<br />
something to stand on when feet leave the ground<br />
some light in the darkest… where we grope.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Love Like the Spring<br />
</strong>(a poem)</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_935" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://jesseshanson.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/208.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-935" title="Baba Ram Singh Ji of Bangalore giving darshan to a four-legged friend" alt="208" src="https://jesseshanson.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/208.jpg?w=490&#038;h=275" width="490" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Baba Ram Singh Ji of Bangalore giving darshan to a four-legged friend</p></div>
<p>Maybe now Spring will come, now that news of You has preceded<br />
Winter has been left with all the burden<br />
he was given no choice<br />
he could give but little comfort, yet he gave what was needed</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve dreamt of you in colors white and true and pure<br />
We&#8217;ve imagined You—we didn&#8217;t know who You were<br />
when we would go to bed crying from the cold<br />
when we&#8217;d wake up, still dying from growing old</p>
<p>Are these the days of old, or is the world yet young?<br />
For all we know, we&#8217;re in the dark<br />
just primitives around the fire<br />
all simulation, full of wow and flutter<br />
ending lonely, homeless, reduced to mutter<br />
while the world races along on fuel and spark</p>
<p>When my Master left, I had not yet begun<br />
I stood alone on the hot sand beneath the burning sun<br />
I turned stupidly, confused, and in all directions<br />
not another living soul to understand my objections</p>
<p>When Winter came, it was good to be buried<br />
under the snow so deep, under the frozen grass<br />
until the longing could stir again<br />
But as a seeker I have no skills<br />
I go this way and that; so vulnerable against strong wills<br />
But could my weakness prove to be Your strength at last?</p>
<p>You begged Him to accept that man on the end<br />
who had consumed alcohol and meat, so then<br />
Maybe, for me too, You could put such a request<br />
that could soften His heart—since I can&#8217;t pass the test<br />
since I&#8217;ve never become strong like the rest<br />
since all my failures, I&#8217;ve confessed</p>
<p>Maybe You will appear like the Spring<br />
bringing the sun and the rain in contrast<br />
over the windswept hills of this time<br />
Maybe love will have no choice<br />
but to sing of my pain and loss with Your voice<br />
but to answer with the future and to leave behind the past</p>

<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Stepping out on a limb with this one. Hope you will appreciate it. Had to get it out; it was weighing me down. As always, I am very grateful to my readers. Please comment if you feel so inclined. I&#8217;m glad tomatoes are out of season. (:&lt;)&gt;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Spirituality</b></p>
<p>It seems like the closer we get to people on the outside<br />
the farther away they are on the inside<br />
I would gather my friends about me<br />
but I can’t bear to feel that lonely</p>
<p>I heard my friend crying out<br />
in the mournful way of the forlorn<br />
and I ran to bring some comfort<br />
but when I arrived, that voice was dying out<br />
and I was greeted with such scorn</p>
<p>Spirituality is a lonesome battle<br />
don’t kid yourself, old son<br />
Spirituality is a bitter pill<br />
don’t look at anyone<br />
Spirituality is a chain gang, man<br />
the worst is yet to come<br />
Spirituality comes as a hypocrite, saying<br />
This is the way it’s done<br />
Spirituality is a blind eye turned<br />
to the dying embers of the sun<br />
Spirituality is an empty park<br />
where the children used to run</p>
<p>Spirituality is a well of impatience<br />
where we drink our leaders’ poison<br />
Spirituality is a pecking order<br />
where the strongest beast is the one enjoying<br />
Spirituality is a parade of masks<br />
in which, all secrets are revealed<br />
Spirituality is a fairy tale<br />
where the hearts of fools are sealed<br />
Spirituality is the sport of the pompous<br />
of the gurus and the pundits<br />
Spirituality is for the hairy apes<br />
My god, I’ve been there, done it</p>
<p>Aren’t you tired of what spirituality is?<br />
of what it has become?<br />
Aren’t you tired of, even religion being more pure<br />
I thought maybe you were<br />
Aren’t you tired of dying in false promise?<br />
of your brother being your enemy?<br />
I’m tired of spirituality, I tell you<br />
I’m a spring wound tight to breaking for spirituality<br />
I’m a lunatic with hands a’shaking</p>
<p>Get me out of this god dammed spirituality asylum<br />
where no one has a clue!</p>
<p>Think all you have to do<br />
is say God, God, God<br />
Well… I’ll hide it from you<br />
If you want them to think you’re crazy<br />
just tell them one thing that’s true</p>
<p>Spirituality is a firm and stern correction<br />
for reaching out to anyone<br />
Spirituality is the distant echo<br />
of a graveyard full of fun<br />
Spirituality is the common thread<br />
of the burned out bitter ones<br />
Spirituality is perpetual movement<br />
toward nothing ever getting done<br />
Spirituality is at the gates of fear<br />
where the pitiful wailing songs are sung</p>
<p>All I wanted was to love and be loved<br />
How did I get involved with this spirituality?</p>
<p>I heard my friend crying out<br />
in a voice so lost and real<br />
and I ran to bring some comfort<br />
but when I arrived, that voice was dying out<br />
as if, after all, it was no big deal</p>

<p>Dear Readers,      This is a re-post from <strong>The BlueHome Blog</strong> (the blog I write for <a title="bluehomeartworks.com" href="http://www.bluehomeartworks.com/bluehome/content/4-about-us" target="_blank">bluehomeartworks.com)</a>. If you follow that link you can read about BlueHome Artworks, which is—in a nutshell—a consignment outlet in support of the artists and craftspersons in the New Vrindavan, West Virginia community and surrounding area.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share the post here also, as it relates and is important to me personally, as a songwriter, musician, and poet. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy the read, and if you&#8217;re local, come out and join us. As always, thanks for visiting my blog, and please leave a comment if so inclined.   Namaste, jesse</p>
<h2>The BlueHome Artworks Tea House Project</h2>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>The following is a blog in two parts:</strong><br />
The first part serves as an announcement of an event that will be held bi-monthly in New Vrindavan.<br />
The second part is Lilasuka&#8217;s article (Lilasuka—as the Communications Director for New Vrindavan—writes most of the NV news articles) in the Brijabasi Spirit Blog. I&#8217;ve simply re-posted that blog article.</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright" alt="Jaya Rishi &amp; Devananda Pundit" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bluehomeartworks.com/bluehome/img/cms/DSCF3227.JPG" width="250" height="187" /></p>

<p>Dearest Friends and Devotees,</p>
<p>Jesse and Lilasuka Hanson would like to invite you to be part of a new <strong>bi-monthly </strong> <del datetime="2013-01-29T14:38"> </del><del datetime="2013-01-29T14:37"> </del><strong><del datetime="2013-01-28T17:08">coffee  </del><del datetime="2013-01-29T14:37"> </del><del datetime="2013-01-29T14:38"> </del> </strong><strong>Tea House Project</strong>, hosted by the   <strong>BlueHome  Artworks</strong> Gift Shop: <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Essentially, it will be a Songwriters, Musicians, and Poetry Circle. This will be a very unique and informal group, plus <strong>the public will be invited to attend—no charge—come and go as you please</strong>. New Vrindavan’s own remarkably talented cast of songwriters, musicians, storytellers, and poets will be taking turns, sharing their work and their talents in an informal setting. The event will be easy on the ears—<strong>acoustic</strong> (meaning without amplification or drums, other than a microphone for the vocalists or readers, when necessary, and the possibility of low volume bass/lead guitar or other instruments requiring electricity, played at low volumes). Hand percussion, such as mrdanga, tabla, djembe, etc. will of course be welcome.</p>
<p>Musicians, don’t worry if you’re not a songwriter. When it’s your turn, play whatever tasteful music you like. Our intention is just that this project is open to creativity, and kirtan will not be the focus, but neither will it be excluded.</p>
<p>The Teahouse Project was inspired by an informal gathering held<strong> </strong>at the gift shop last Sunday, when Jaya Rishi gathered a few musicians together.</p>
<p>The next event will be held in the music room of the school on <strong>Thursday evening, February 14</strong> (happens to be Valentines Day), at <strong>5:30 pm</strong>. <strong>Subsequent events will be held on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Thursdays of each month.</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to get the word out, asap, but we will, of course, send another reminder before the first Tea House event.</p>

<p>by Lilasuka dasi</p>
<p>The other day,  after the Sunday feast, some of New Vrindavan’s finest musical talents dropped by the BlueHome Artworks Gift Shop. They went there to share their music and to jam along with each other’s songs.</p>
<p>The night before, Jaya Rishi had approached Jesse, “I’ve invited some musicians to my room in the temple after the Sunday feast to get together for some music. Would you and Lila like to come?”</p>
<p>“Sure, thank you. But, hey, why not have it at Bluehome Artworks Gift Shop, where it might be more roomy and comfortable? And besides, since your room’s in the men’s asrama,  then Lila will actually be able to come.”</p>
<p>And so it was.   Everyone sat in a circle in the Gift Shop, and one at a time, each musician led a song of their choice.  Most of the musicians there sang songs that they themselves had written.</p>
<p>After they’d gone around the circle about 3 times, everyone seemed very satisfied. Some were pleasantly surprised hearing their godsiblings’ music for the first time.</p>
<p>Jason, a new devotee at New Vrindavan who has been a drummer for some time, said, “I’ve been very interested in getting involved somehow in music in New Vrindavan, so this gathering has been especially nice for me.”</p>
<p>Jesse explains, “This music event tonight really inspired me toward a project in which I’ve been interested for some time. Lila and I have wanted to host gatherings of musicians, songwriters, poets and writers, since N.V. is a community full of talent. Tonight turned out to be a great start!”</p>
<p>Jesse added, “I especially liked the way everyone took turns and paid attention to each other’s offerings.”</p>
<p>Look for an invitation to be sent out soon, inviting everyone, including listeners, to future gatherings of this type.</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p>Well&#8230; the invitation is, of course, in the first part of this post.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve been conspicuously absent. I&#8217;ve been working night and day to establish our  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="BlueHome Artworks" href="http://www.bluehomeartworks.com/bluehome/" target="_blank">BlueHome Artworks</a></span> consignment shop within the New Vrindaban Community.  I started a blog there as part of the online store/website: <a title="The BlueHome Blog" href="http://www.bluehomeartworks.com/bluehome/blog/2_the-blue-home-blog.html" target="_blank">The BlueHome Blog</a>, where I talk about the value of thinking small, in terms of supporting small and local businesses, artisans making hand crafted products, agriculture, etc. Village economy, really.</p>
<p>So you can check that sight and blog out if you&#8217;re inclined to. Here, I intend to maintain my personal stuff, including my writing, my spiritual quest and ponderings, etc. I know; it&#8217;s a summer picture I&#8217;ve posted, but the current view from our home is a little bleak right now, since we don&#8217;t have snow yet—at least not any that&#8217;s stuck. But as you can see, it is snowing on the picture anyway.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my new poem. It does, in fact, contain some of those ponderings. I hope you enjoy it. As always, I invite you to comment if you feel like it.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Setting my Sights</h1>
<p><b>Jesse S. Hanson</b></p>
<p>My Father is dead but my real Father lives<br />
My real Father is dead but my even more real Father lives<br />
Jesse is gone but then he never was<br />
I never could find him<br />
Just some vague familiarity with someone who always disappointed</p>
<p>Where is my family, my kin?<br />
I wait for them on the shore where the boats come and go<br />
But not them, no<br />
Where are my dogs and my horses?</p>
<p>I don’t see them run and bark and whinny<br />
Over the hills, willy-nilly<br />
Where are my girls, where are my boys?</p>
<p>My songs are dead but my real song sings<br />
My dreams are dead but my real dream waits<br />
For me to wake up<br />
From dead and dying dreams</p>
<p>I have to set out<br />
I have to go on a fearsome adventure<br />
I have to set out across the wilderness with only faith<br />
Since I lack courage<br />
Since I lack vision<br />
Since I lack identity</p>
<p>I’ve always had to cry as the years have gone by<br />
Where are my rolling prairies?<br />
Well, those men have plowed them<br />
Where are my towering hills and splendid valleys?<br />
Those men cut them down, dug them out, they were sold out for baubles<br />
And a plastic future<br />
Where is my beach, my little house on the ocean?<br />
All washed up, built up, soiled, overgrown, weeds and litter</p>
<p>My land is dead but my real land lives<br />
My Father is buried but my real Father lives<br />
My real Father is cremated but my more real Father lives<br />
Jesse is gone but then he never was<br />
I have to go to another land<br />
I will grow weary of this childish tantrum<br />
These sentimental tears</p>
<p>I will become forgetful of all things behind me<br />
Become tired of mourning a life that did not care for me<br />
A home that was not there for me<br />
I’ll set my sights on the unknown distance<br />
Across the ocean of this lost existence</p>
<p>My Father is dead but he’ll be forgotten<br />
My real Father has gone on ahead<br />
My even more real Father is here waiting.</p>

<p>Here I have listed a selection of websites with Information concerning the Masters of my spiritual Path. This ancient Path has been known by various names down through the course of history, including: <strong>Sant Mat</strong>—<strong>Surat Shabd Yoga</strong>—<strong>The Path of the Masters</strong>—<strong>The Way of the Saints</strong>—<strong>Science of the Soul</strong>—<strong>Radasoami Satsang</strong>—<strong>Ruhani Satsang</strong>, and many others, depending upon the lineage and culture of the Living Master of the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/ruhani.htm">http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/ruhani.htm</a>       –a USA based site in memory <strong>of Kirpal Singh</strong> of Delhi, India [1894-1974](first Sant Mat Master to visit the Western world. Master Kirpal first came to America in the 1950&#8217;s.)This is a great site for obtaining Master Kirpal&#8217;s books and other media.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.santji.allegre.ca/4-index.html">http://www.santji.allegre.ca/4-index.html</a>         –USA based memorial site for <strong>Ajaib Singh </strong> <strong>[</strong>known by many of his followers as <strong>Sant Ji] </strong>of Rajasthan, India [1926-1997] (Gurumukh disciple of Kirpal Singh­) (Sant Ajaib is Jesse&#8217;s Master)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.santji.allegre.ca/lifesj/lifesj.html">http://www.santji.allegre.ca/lifesj/lifesj.html</a>       –this is a page from the previous site, but I listed it here because it contains both a beautiful brief biography of Sant Ji and a lineage of the Masters, going back to Kabir, Who was the first Sant Mat Master to appear in the age of Kali Yuga.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ajaibbani.org/">http://www.ajaibbani.org/</a>        – this India based website was created and is maintained by the residents of Ajaib&#8217;s home and ashram in Rajasthan.</p>
<p><em><a title="ajaib.com" href="http://ajaib.com/" target="_blank">http://ajaib.com/ </a>      </em>a website with a lot of information and material relating to Sants Kirpal and Ajaib as well as <strong>Sadhu Ram Ji</strong>. It is called&#8221; Sant Ajaib Singh Ji Memorial Site&#8221;. This site is created by the followers of Sadhu Ram Ji.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediaseva.com/">http://www.mediaseva.com/</a>        –this website is a great source of the books and other media of the modern Masters. It is run by the devotees of <strong>Sadhu Ram Ji</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/53735046/Sant-Ram-Singh-Ji-A-Brief-Life-Sketch" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/53735046/Sant-Ram-Singh-Ji-A-Brief-Life-Sketch</a>  -Not to be confused with sites concerning Sadhu Ram, this is the biography of <strong>Baba Ram Singh Ji</strong> of <strong>Bangalore.</strong> Ram Singh was initiated by Baba Somanath, a contemporary of Kirpal Singh. Somanath&#8217;s mission was in South India and He had a great many disciples in that area. When Somanath left the body, Ram Singh was only nineteen years old. He then followed and remained under the guidance of Ajaib Singh until Ajaib left the body. He considers both Masters to be His Gurus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.santbani.hu/">http://www.santbani.hu/</a>      –a website concerning <strong>Sirio Carrapa</strong> of Ribolla, Italy [1952-    ](Italian disciple of Kirpal Singh and long-time representative of Ajaib Singh­) This is the English version of a site that originates in Hungary. Sirio considers both Kirpal Singh and Ajaib Singh to be His Gurus.</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.santbaniashram.it/">www.santbaniashram.it</a>      </cite><em>  </em>–the original Italian website about <strong>Satguru Sirio</strong> Carrapa</p>
<p>There is a great variety of sites with information regarding Sant Mat. It&#8217;s a natural fact that when a true Man of God,<em> or Godman, leaves the earthly plane, there are often a number of successors who carry on the work of</em> their Master. Sometimes there are controversies among the devotees over the authenticity of these successors.</p>
<p>With that in mind, but having no intention of in engaging in controversy, I have noted here only a certain few websites that concern the Guru lineage, as I understand it leading to my Master Ajaib. I will state my personal opinion that I do not believe the issue of successorship can be decided on an intellectual level―&#8221;But the Master said this&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;there is a will&#8230;&#8221; and so forth. To me, it is purely a matter of recognition. As Master Kirpal Singh used to say, &#8220;If your old Friend comes to you in a new coat, won&#8217;t you recognize Him?&#8221; I pray that with His grace, all the <em>dear ones </em>will find themselves at the Feet of their perfect Guru―their perfect Friend.</p>
<p>The authenticity of other branches: I honestly know little of them. I understand spirituality as a very personal experience, and that, in all reality, we do not choose or find our Master or Guru, but rather He finds us. He leads us to Him. He makes us come to the satsang. He makes us sit and meditate. He makes us do His seva (service). It is all in His Will and pleasure.</p>
<p>Most fortunate are the recipients of the Guru&#8217;s undying, unconditional, and all-encompassing Love.</p>

I wanted to post, just briefly here, about our very encouraging and well received opening in conjunction with the annual Festival of Inspiration.</em></p>
<p>Thanks so much to all who visited the shop and showed support, including Maharaja Radhanath Ji, who suggested that, with the shop providing an outlet for people&#8217;s artistic creations, we would start a renaissance. Temple president, Jaya Krsna, had also stated, upon hearing of our proposal for the shop, &#8220;I like very much the idea of the store. It will encourage more devotees to work on their propensities.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had quite an enjoyable, successful, and encouraging opening weekend at our new BlueHome Artworks consignment shop. It was the annual Festival of Inspiration and the shop was well received, supported, and patronized by those attending. The weather was mostly fine&#8211;sunny and cool&#8211;until Sunday, which was rainy, but spirits seemed undampened. (:&lt;)&gt;</p>
<p>Especially, thanks to all the fine artists and artisans who have contributed and intend to contribute to the shop by consigning their work with us. The quality of work is outstanding, even exceeding expectations. We really cannot sufficiently express our appreciation. &#8211;Lilasuka and Jesse</p>
<p><em>As always, thanks for stopping by my blog, and please feel free to comment, if so inspired. </em></p>

Sibley.  It is a work that covers a lot of ground, touches on many social issues—issues that concern both artists and the homeless. These two concerns have formed a type of personal collage in John&#8217;s world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Although my roots (in this particular physical manifestation) are small town Upper Midwest America and John&#8217;s are inner city, Chicago, interestingly enough, I can relate. I have little in common with John&#8217;s upbringing, but my artistic longings and aspirations drew me to the city also—in my case it was Seattle, where I spent a period of my life as a street musician, immersed in the &#8220;culture&#8221; of the Pike Place Market and other local haunts, in the company of other musicians, artists, poets, crafts persons, vendors, entrepreneurs of  questionable pursuits, alcoholics, drug addicts, homeless persons, and derelicts of great variety. I can relate, and I can confirm: the subjects of artists and homelessness are easily intertwined. John has, in fact, done this successfully and has become a type of spokesman for the underground artist, in doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">As always, I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy my review and that you&#8217;ll leave a comment if so inclined. Thanks for coming by,  Jesse S. Hanson</p>

<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p align="center"><strong></strong> </p>
<p align="center"><strong>A Multi-faceted Look at the Life of an Underground Artist </strong></p>
<p>John H. Sibley&#8217;s new literary work, Being and Homelessness: Notes from an Underground Artist, is an important and welcome contribution, arriving as it does, at a time when the <em>scene</em> of the art world is mostly cordoned off to all but the privileged elect. From my nosebleed seat in the bloody colosseum of the arts—being an underground artist myself—I often found myself cheering along as John attacked the giants, demons and all fierce bastions of that world with eloquence and candor.</p>
<p> <em>&#8220;I was relegated to selling my art on the street level not because I lacked talent but because I was shunned, ostracized and treated like a pariah by both Chicago&#8217;s white and black art establishments.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Taken out of context, as I have done here, I realize it sounds like <em>sour grapes</em>, like the complaint of an artist who has likely not put in the required effort, not stayed the course, or does, in fact, lack the talent to succeed. Not so: Not only has John been practicing and honing his unique artistic crafts since he was a young boy, but he is a graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. His knowledge of the academics and history of art is formidable and that is only enhanced by the practical knowledge of a man of the streets.</p>
<p>However, there is much more to Being and Homelessness than a diatribe against the art establishment. I particularly enjoyed Chapter 8, The Lost Culture of Maxwell Street. This chapter deals with the multicultural open-air market atmosphere, highlighted by the legendary Chicago Blues culture that manifested for a period of some forty plus years. I had previously read this chapter, when it was posted on goodreads.com, and found it fascinating. The following is taken from the comment that I wrote, regarding the post, at that time: <em>&#8220;This is very gritty and intense. It seems to be written just like someone is talking; telling about, reveling in their experience of life</em><em>—stream of consciousness. There&#8217;s just so much in there, almost more than the senses can deal with. Life experienced as a perpetual street fair</em>—<em>exhausting and thrilling at once.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Another aspect of John&#8217;s book that I appreciated was his exploration of Black history in America. Here again, Sibley pulls no punches in presenting his facts and opinions:</p>
<p>–example of facts:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The first slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619 to establish 244 years of slavery.</em></p>
<p><em>Contemporary African Americans have only been free 139 years, using 1863 as a benchmark, which means that blacks were slaves 105 years longer than we have been free.&#8221;</em></p>
<p> –example of opinion:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The salient fact is that black Americans are still reeling from the dehumanizing effects of the former slave trading nations of England, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the US.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I certainly am not a fan of John H. Sibley&#8217;s every opinion. I don&#8217;t personally agree with his outspoken political criticism of Barack Obama, and especially with his endorsement of Herman Cain —I at first thought it was a huge literary blunder for him to include such opinions in his book. But after ruminating on it for a while, I think I can see a reason for the inclusion. His main point seems to be that Obama, although a black man, is not an &#8220;African American&#8221;<em>. &#8220;Obama&#8217;s world is not the one of American slaves like my ancestors.&#8221;</em> Sibley is exploring the experience of the American descendants of the slaves. Fact is—and I can&#8217;t deny it—Obama is not one of them—Cain is. It&#8217;s a pure issue of identification.</p>
<p>For those of you who may have read Sibley&#8217;s novel, Bodyslick, this work is, in my opinion, much more palatable. It is, in fact, as has been mentioned in another review, a fast and easy read. For the most part it takes me back to my earlier reading of Chapter 8, The Lost Culture of Maxwell Street. The editing is questionable—I hope you won&#8217;t let that bother you. If you have an interest, even a curiosity about the life of art, outside of the mainstream, spoon-fed versions, this book will be of interest to you. If you have an interest in the causes and experience of the homeless, this book will interest you also, though it is not its main theme, despite the title. Recommended: by a fellow underground artist.</p>

			<p>Dear readers, I&#8217;m currently in the process of compiling a selection of my songs and poems, with the intention of creating a volume that will include both. However, the songs to choose from vastly outnumber the poems—I&#8217;ve been involved with the songwriting much longer. Consequently, I&#8217;m in the process of writing poetry, to help the balance. Happily, I&#8217;m in a poetry writing mood.</p>
<p>So I wanted to share my newest poem here, <em>for the words</em>, which is about my spiritual practice and is in memory of my great Friend and spiritual Master, Ajaib Singh.</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for coming by to read my blog. I welcome your comments.<br />
                                     Namaste,   jesse s. hanson</p>

<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>for the words<br />
          </strong>–jesse s. hanson</p>
<p>How can I go forward<br />
how can I be quiet<br />
with a mind that will not<br />
I close my eyes but the words fall from my ears<br />
and will not stay inside<br />
I&#8217;m so afraid of my imminent destruction<br />
the awful risk of spiritual failure<br />
I&#8217;m afraid of being driven from Your love<br />
onto the featureless plain, alone<br />
where no conversation with a friend of God remains<br />
where no one sings and all songs are in vain<br />
A most insistent, utterly silent voice is calling out in mourning<br />
in anxious petition<br />
In such uncertainty I scrabble about<br />
unable to focus<br />
on trembling hands and knees<br />
grasping<br />
for the words<br />
that could catch Your ear<br />
bring Your attention to me here </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak for fear of losing something<br />
I can&#8217;t be still for the hope of seeing someone<br />
I&#8217;ve lost all fascinations<br />
but too late<br />
too late, too late, too late…<br />
Don&#8217;t let it be too late<br />
Ajaib,  strangely wonderful, mystical lion<br />
I&#8217;ve no recourse but Your good graces<br />
I&#8217;ve haunted this place behind a million faces<br />
and still, no one recognizes me<br />
though I&#8217;ve appeared again and again with my relentless longing<br />
although I&#8217;ve married their sons and daughters<br />
fought beside them in their wars and died with them<br />
filled their skies with my crazy raucous laughter<br />
and then filled their bellies with my fetus<br />
looked into their eyes, playing the infant<br />
I&#8217;ve learned their ways, holding their faith<br />
lost my way on their bitter streets<br />
fell beneath their heavy feet<br />
to return without their sympathy<br />
I&#8217;ve lost all fascinations<br />
but now my back is old and weak<br />
and will not stand for dedication<br />
to Your purpose<br />
to Your perfect words of love</p>
<p>so… You repeat them in me<br />
until I&#8217;m stronger<br />
Having said it<br />
having asked it<br />
I lie down in exasperation<br />
and dream a dream of realization</p>
<p>Across the glamorous sky in perfect silence<br />
the moon in pallid dream reveals the course<br />
the stars in all their brilliance cannot match her subtle bloom<br />
flower of the night<br />
keeper of the secrets<br />
long held by the lovers and those inspired<br />
to seek the distant truth within<br />
O gentle light, so wan and thin<br />
under which to weep for boys and men<br />
whose character is never spent in vain<br />
by whose delicate form my heart is soothed again<br />
Ignite a pale spark of my resolve<br />
a reminder, after all<br />
What else is there to do<br />
out on this trail of incarnations<br />
I&#8217;m going to leave, for now, ambitions<br />
concerns and dangerous missions<br />
release them to the earth below<br />
forget the things that I remember<br />
and remember that I&#8217;ve come here searching<br />
for words that tell no story<br />
words that speak the truth<br />
in the stillness of silence<br />
in the music of unborn conscious spirit<br />
no clinging now<br />
no owning<br />
no question how<br />
no thinking<br />
collecting words in mental silence</p>
