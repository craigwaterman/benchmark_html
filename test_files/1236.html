              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Josh Beckett no-hit the Phillies on May 25<sup>th</sup>, Clayton Kershaw no-hit the Rockies on June 18<sup>th</sup> striking out 15 along the way, Dee Gordon came out of nowhere to lead the league in stolen bases, and 5 Dodgers have a batting average of .260 or better. All this and more has been taking place in Chavez Ravine, yet 70% of Angelinos have yet to see any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year Time Warner Cable and the Dodgers reached a 25-year/ $7 billion television deal. The network holds exclusive rights to all Dodger games (except a select few nationally televised games). Unfortunately, Time Warner and the other cable networks are locked in a stalemate over negotiations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time Warner Cable is no stranger to deals like this, and if history has shown us anything, Time Warner doesn&rsquo;t scare too easily when it comes to this kind of thing. Padres fans who had Cox Cable- a Time Warner Affiliate- remember being blacked out of games for TWO years before Fox Sports San Diego and TWC reached an agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lakers fans were slightly luckier- when Time Warner and the Lakers organization came to a 20-year/$3 billion agreement LA residents were only without Laker games for about a month before a deal was reached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SportsNet LA aired on February 25<sup>th</sup> 2014- it has been 6 very dark months for dodger fans, and there seems to be no end in sight. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have one of the few smaller market cable companies who has picked up SportsNet LA, and while nothing beats seeing 2 no-hitters this season, the price increase I&rsquo;ve seen on my bill really isn&rsquo;t worth the few games I actually get to sit down and watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The All-Star game is next week, and the Dodgers are currently sitting atop the NL West and yet millions have missed half of a season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s really losing here? Sure advertisers are losing money, and Time Warner has a $7 billion bill and no other companies are helping pay the tab, but who are the real losers here? At the risk of sounding totally clich&eacute;, I believe it&rsquo;s the kids. Thousands of kids who are just becoming interested in baseball are losing out on a chance to see the greatest pitcher in baseball, one of the most electric outfielders in the game, and most importantly are losing out on a chance to hear a 65 year veteran in his field say his famous &ldquo;<a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/81237736559/itfdb-openingseries-dodgersbaseball-dodgers" title="It's Time For Dodger Baseball" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s Time For Dodger Baseball</a>&rdquo; before each game. It&rsquo;s sad to know a generation of Dodger fans will be missing out on potentially one of the last few seasons in a long standing career of the greatest baseball announcer in history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can catch Vin Scully on AM 570 for the first 3 innings of the game, but 3 innings seems like a minuscule amount of time for Vin to impart his extensive wisdom of the game on anyone. So hopefully a deal is reached soon, otherwise Dodger fans could be looking at a long Dodger-less summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the light at the end of the tunnel in all this? The Dodgers play 4 games against the Angels August 4<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup>, so at least we&rsquo;ll be able to catch those games on Fox Sports West.&nbsp;</p>

              <h2><a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/80897004768/puig-vs-trout-who-is-the-bigger-power-house-in">Puig vs. Trout Who Is the Bigger Power House in LA?</a></h2>
              <p>The 2014 season has already gotten underway for the Dodgers, but before opening the U.S. season, they take on cross-town rivals The Angels in an exhibition Freeway Series this weekend. Two of baseball&rsquo;s break-out stars play in LA, Mike Trout of the Angels, and Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers. Trout makes amazing leaps to rob hitters of homeruns while Puig&rsquo;s speed and arm keep runners from advancing to extra bases.</p>
<p>The 2014 season will be a great time to see these two players in action, but who really is better?</p>
<p>If we go solely on individual performance the numbers are close, Trout&rsquo;s been in the league longer and has put up some impressive numbers, but in the short time Puig has been in the majors he&rsquo;s put up some pretty ridiculous statistics as well. &nbsp;Trout has an edge on Puig even just in the numbers from June 3<sup>rd</sup> &ndash;when Puig was called up. In 368 plate appearances since June Trout had a .388 batting average with 67 runs, 60 RBI&rsquo;s and an on base percentage of .466. Puig&rsquo;s numbers were great too, just not as great as Trout&rsquo;s in 382 plate appearances Puig had a .319 batting average, 66 runs, 42 RBI&rsquo;s and a .391 on base percentage. The only statistic Puig bested Trout in &ndash;and even still, just barely- was home runs, Puig had 19 to Trout&rsquo;s 17. So while Trout takes a slight lead here, the statistics maybe too close to call.</p>
<p>Team impact is another big factor in player performance. A player can be great on his own but if he brings no excitement to the team then what even is the point? Puig clearly wins this category. He joined a last place, injury riddled team half way through the season, and was a big reason they went on a historic 42-8 run. The Dodgers, with the assistance of Puig&rsquo;s big bat and powerful right field presence, went from last place in the NL West, to first place and had an impressive playoff run. Trout on the other hand made his major league debut in 2011, &nbsp;and in 2012 he was called up again by the Angels. The Angels however haven&rsquo;t been to the playoffs since Trout joined their roster. So Puig wins this round, but it seems the two players are very evenly matched.</p>
<p>The final factor to determine who the better outfielder is in LA is maturity; personally I think this is the most important factor you can use to judge a player. How Trout and Puig carry themselves on and off the field really says more than any statistic could ever determine. Mike Trout wins this category by leaps and bounds. He had 86 strike outs last season from June on, while Yasiel had 97. Many of Puig&rsquo;s 97 strikeouts come from an immaturity at the plate that can be seen from the bat flips each time he swings, and the constant feigned injuries each time he strikes out. Off the field, Puig&rsquo;s immaturity doesn&rsquo;t stop, he&rsquo;s gotten 2 tickets for reckless driving, and has a sense of entitlement that doesn&rsquo;t match his numbers, and has begun to take a toll on the patience of many Dodgers veterans. Mike Trout however seems calm, cool and collected when on the field and has the confidence one would expect from a great player, without the unwanted cockiness. He also seems to be able to separate his on field performance from off-field distractions like contract negotiations.</p>
<p>So who is the better player? They are each equally exciting to watch, Trout being much more fundamentally sound, while Puig plays in a reckless, &ldquo;what is he going to do next&rdquo; kind of way that makes every play interesting. Yasiel Puig is a great player, and he brings an excitement the Dodgers haven&rsquo;t had in years. But he also brings an immaturity that in the long run will prove to be a major distraction as the Dodgers try to make their first real World Series push since 2009. Mike Trout has also been an exciting addition to the Anaheim lineup, but hasn&rsquo;t had the post-season impact that Puig has had.</p>
<p>So the numbers don&rsquo;t lie, the two players are equally talented, and may be too evenly matched to make a decision. Even though it kills me to say it, Mike Trout wins this, he goes out there each day, plays the game and puts up killer numbers for the Angels, off the field, he doesn&rsquo;t bring too much attention to himself. He&rsquo;s not a distraction for the other players on the field, and unlike Puig- he&rsquo;s patient at the plate. That kind of impact on a team is much more viable and long-term than a few months of excitement when a player first gets called up and puts up seemingly impossible numbers.</p>
<p>Although Trout won this time, this is a Dodgers blog. So let&rsquo;s just take a moment to admire Puig&rsquo;s on field work with this video from a March 6<sup>th</sup> spring training game verse the two teams:<a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/80896781057" title="Here" target="_blank"> Here</a></p>

              <h2><a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/80447393851/its-a-sweep-in-sydney">It&rsquo;s A Sweep In Sydney</a></h2>
              <p>It seems like just yesterday the Dodgers were leaving St. Louis in a crushing 9-0 loss to the Cardinals in game 6 of the NLCS. After that game, Dodger fans focused their attention on the 2014 season, getting-and staying healthy, and the opening series in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>Well the Australia trip has come and gone, and the Dodgers have regaled us with tales of a land down under. From <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ls1xT5rENX/" target="_blank">Clayton Kershaw</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/p/luuPVVLELM/" target="_blank">Vin Scully&rsquo;s new furry friends</a>, to <a href="http://dodgers.mlblogs.com/2014/03/19/its-australian-for-dodger-mate/?partnerId=as_lad_20140320_20377104" target="_blank">the Australian accents</a> the dodgers picked up while in Sydney. The Dodgers have been participating in many local activities, and cuisines native to Australia.</p>
<p>The big story coming out of Australia &ndash;of course- was the opening series games, a two game match up between the Dodgers and the Arizona Dbacks at the historic Sydney Cricket Grounds</p>
<p>In the first regular-season game of 2014 Clayton Kershaw battled Arizona&rsquo;s Wade Miley. The Dodgers&rsquo; ace made his fourth consecutive opening-day start, and while he didn&rsquo;t hit any <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play;_ylt=A2KIo9iWmS5TD1cAhqv7w8QF;_ylu=X3oDMTB2ZGttbmIxBHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDdmlkBHZ0aWQDVjExNgRncG9zAzI-?p=kershaw+hits+homerun+against+giants&amp;vid=52f6dcdd5c690dacc693ba1d7c9dd51d&amp;l=1%3A40&amp;turl=http%3A%2F%2Fts4.mm.bing.net%252" target="_blank">homeruns</a> this year, he did pitch 6.2 innings with 7&nbsp;K, 1ER and 5 hits; Brian Wilson pitched the 8<sup>th</sup> inning and Kenley Jansen got the save.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ball, Scott Van Slyke got the nod to play left field due to absences from Kemp and Crawford. In the second inning Van Slyke got robbed of a homerun due to wind, but the double set up Gonzales to score on a single by Andre Either. In the fourth inning, Van Slyke got redemption when he ripped one over the right field fence with Gonzalez on base to put the Dodgers up 3-0.</p>

<p>The second game of the season saw Hyun-Jin Ryu topple Trevor Cahill. In an explosive outing, Dee Gordon went 3-for-4 with a double, a single on an error by Aaron Hill and a bunt that turned into a double on an error by Miguel Montero.</p>
<p>Puig also had a great afternoon, going 3-for-5 with 2 singles, a double and a HBP in the fourth inning that had fans of both teams holding their breaths remembering the bench clearing brawl in June of last season between the two clubs. Remarks made by Diamondbacks GM Kevin Towers in October about retaliation didn&rsquo;t seem to smooth things over, but luckily nothing came of it.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks made an impressive run in the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> inning. Trumbo hit an RBI single in the 8<sup>th</sup> to prevent a shutout, and in the 9<sup>th</sup> Martin Prado hit a 2-run RBI Single followed by a 2-run HR by Trumbo. Ultimately the Dodgers ended the inning, ended the series with a sweep, and ended their time in Australia on a high note-a full game ahead of the rest of the league.</p>
<p>The Dodgers fly back to Los Angeles tomorrow (3/23) and play 3 more exhibition games against the Angels before heading down to San Diego on Sunday the 30<sup>th</sup> to start the regular season here in the States.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Alright ladies and gentlemen,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dodgers are down under in Sydney, Australia until next week,&nbsp;and they haven&rsquo;t missed a single opportunity to take pictures with the locals, and even some of the local furry creatures!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I present to you all, what can easily be considered the greatest picture to ever grace the internet.&nbsp;<img alt="image" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/47cba7188a5559618afb836efc6dcc1c/tumblr_inline_n2q2edxrZg1s5u7tf.png"></p>

<p>The Dodgers official Twitter account posted a picture of the always classy, Mr. Vin Scully holding a Koala Bear earlier today, and it&rsquo;s safe to say that we can all die happy after having seen this picture. To see more photos and videos of the Dodgers trip to Sydney visit their twitter account at <a href="https://twitter.com/dodgers" title="Here" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/dodgers</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Dodgers" title="here" target="_blank"><br></a></p>

<p>The Dodgers play an exhibition game tomorrow March, 20th against team Australia with Zach Lee taking the mound. As well as a double header of regular season games against &nbsp;the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday March 22nd at 1pm and 7pm with Kershaw and Ryu pitching respectively. They come home to play 3 more spring games against the Angels on March 27th, 28th, and 29th before the regular season begins on the 30th.&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Tonight the Dodgers looked to pad their lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks, and keep up with the Atlanta Braves for the best record in the NL. After dropping their fourth game last night, including a sweep by the Cincinnati Reds, the Los Angeles Dodgers looked post-season ready tonight against the division rival Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dodgers bats were hot at Chavez Ravine as they recorded 12 hits, and 6 home runs. The Dodgers started early, as Andre Ethier homered to put the Dodgers up 1-0 in the second inning. Immediately after, Uribe went yard for his first time of the night. Gonzales hit a 2 run shot in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and with 2 outs Uribe hit his second bomb of the night. In the fifth inning, with the Dodgers up 5-0, Didi Gregorius doubled to right, Puig missed the catch, and Martin Prado scored, 5-1. The Dodgers didn&rsquo;t stop there, Ramirez Homered in the 5<sup>th</sup>, and in his next at bat Uribe went deep for the third time of the night. In his final at bat of the night Uribe looked to gain 4 home runs in one game, a feat only performed by one other Dodger, Shawn Green, in May 2002. However keeping in line with the theme of the night, Uribe singled to third scoring Hanley Ramirez.</p>
<p><span>Ricky Nolasco&rsquo;s 8<sup>th</sup> win as a Dodger may have been over shadowed by the bats tonight, but he had a great outing yet again. He went 6.2 innings with 6 strikeouts, and allowed only 1 unearned run and 3 hits. With this win, the Dodgers eliminated the Giants and the Rockies, and lowered their magic number to 8. They looked confident again going into the end of the season and hopefully deep into October!</span></p>

              <h2><a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/58102253303/kemp-robbed">Kemp Robbed?</a></h2>
              <p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk going around about whether or not Ryan Braun should be stripped of his MVP award; many folks, including the Dodgers Skip Schumaker believe Braun should give the award to the second place finisher, Matt Kemp. Schumaker had this to say after the game Monday night, &ldquo;He lied. He lied to a lot of people. I was actually convinced&hellip;that he didn&rsquo;t do anything. I think he should give that MVP trophy to Matt Kemp.&rdquo; There was a lot of controversy surrounding the MVP award that year, and now, especially with the 65 game suspension Ryan Braun received on Monday for violating the Joint Drug Agreement, there will forever be controversy. Ultimately Ryan Braun was awarded the MVP award over Matt Kemp, despite having less home runs, less RBI, and less hits, because the Brewers made it to the playoffs, and the Dodgers did not.</p>
<p>Voting for the MVP award ends before the postseason, but the results are not revealed until after the World Series. In 2011, during the postseason, Ryan Braun tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone; once there was knowledge that Braun won the award, and had also been involved with steroids, the MLB should have immediately pulled him out of the running, and implemented a re-vote. Not only were Matt Kemp&rsquo;s numbers better than Braun in 2011, but had Kemp not been robbed a game against Washington, he could have presumably joined the 40-40 club.</p>
<p>I think the main reason people are so upset by this is because Braun lied to everyone, in fact he almost got away with it! Following testing positive in October 2011 Braun was handed a 50 game suspension. He appealed the suspension in early 2012 and won, stating, &ldquo;It is the first step in restoring my good name and reputation&hellip; I am innocent and the truth is on our side.&rdquo; Fast forward 2 years, and Braun is being suspended 65 games for his connection with Biogenesis and PED use, giving many people reason to think he should hand over the MVP award to Matt Kemp.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now am I saying that Ryan Braun should go to Matt Kemp&rsquo;s house, tail between his legs, and give him his MVP award? No, of course not, nothing will change the history of who was awarded the 2011 NL MVP award, I&rsquo;m just saying, that the MLB made the wrong call. They made the wrong call in 2011 allowing Braun to win the MVP amid steroid use controversy, and they made the wrong call on Monday allowing Braun to take a 65 game suspension knowing full well come next spring he&rsquo;ll be getting a cool 150 million with his new contract extension. The MLB needs to take another look at how they handle players who choose to use steroids, because the majority of players are sick of it, fans are sick of it, and each organization should be held accountable for the players in their clubhouse who make that decision.&nbsp;</p>

              <h2><a href="http://myladodgersblog.tumblr.com/post/55905181135/dodgers-looking-to-edge-ahead-of-the-west-in-the">Dodgers Looking to Edge Ahead of the West in the Second Half of the Season</a></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal">With the second half of the season underway, the Los Angeles Dodgers have their sights set on first place. With a .500 record, sitting at 47-47 they are only 2.5 games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks, and well within reach of the playoffs. A combination of circumstances have propelled the Dodgers&rsquo; squad from an unhopeful last place position in the west to the cusp of first place. Before the second half of the season starts, let&rsquo;s take a look back at the players who contributed to the success of this team.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the most underrated, and often most hated members of the Dodgers, Juan Uribe, is having his best season with the club since being picked up after the 2010 season. Even though Uribe isn&rsquo;t the Dodgers starting third baseman, he&rsquo;s had 5 HR this season, 28 RBI and is batting .289.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While Andre Ethier isn&rsquo;t having his best season ever, the 31 year-old outfielder is hitting .286 with 5 HR on the season. Andre has been excellent at getting on base when the Dodgers need to rally, with a .347 OBP.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis had one of his best months in July, with 9 RBI, A.J. has been clutch for the Dodgers late in games, hitting a late single verse the Dbacks on July 10<sup>th</sup> to force the game into extras.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hanley Ramirez was the hero of that game, hitting the go ahead homer to win it in the 14<sup>th</sup>. Ramirez rejoined the clubhouse on June 4<sup>th</sup> from his second stint on the DL this season and since that first game Ramirez has been on fire. He had 2 HR in July, and a .385 batting average. Ramirez&rsquo;s 19 game hitting streak in June and July was the longest in his career, and in the end of the first half of the season, Ramirez had 6 multi-hit games.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Adrian Gonzales has been the most consistent Dodger this season with 14 HR, 59 RBI, and a .297 batting average. He looks to continue to be the offensive leader of this team in the second half of the season.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Matt Kemp might be the biggest disappointment this season for fans of The Blue Crew, he is currently on his second stint on the disabled list this season and hasn&rsquo;t played a game since re-injuring his left shoulder on July 5<sup>th</sup> in San Francisco. The Dodgers expect him to be back on July 21<sup>st</sup>, but with such a crowded outfield, Kemp might have to prove himself and perform much better than the first half to reclaim his starting position. Kemp has only 4 HR this season and is hitting .254.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One outfielder Kemp will be up against has had all eyes on him since his Dodgers debut on June 3<sup>rd</sup>. while Yasiel Puig had a much slower July than his first month in the majors he&rsquo;s still hitting .391 with 8 HR (Double Matt Kemp&rsquo;s!). Puig has proven to be the spark that started to Dodgers&rsquo; ascension to the top of the division.</p>
<p><span>The Dodgers open the second half of the season tonight against Washington. Match-ups include: Ricky Nolasco V. Stephen Strasburg tonight, Zack Greinke V. Gio Gonzalez on Saturday, and the Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw V. Jordan Zimmermann on Sunday. Even though they lost their last game against Colorado, they hope the momentum from the last few weeks carries over and the team chemistry can bring home the NL West pennant for the first time since the 2009 season.&nbsp;</span></p>
