I am happy you found me....&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Heather....AKA coffee house addict. Wife. Mommy to 3. Sister. Furbaby Mama to ( eh-hum ) 5 . Yes 5. ( It's ok...I clean ..very well.. and it's a good thing... we rescue retired racing greyhounds!) I adore traveling to anywhere, anytime. My fav color is turquoise blue...like the ocean. Did I mention I love coffee? O yay...&amp; I love to read. Chick lit....&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty basic stuff...except I have an obsession with shopping for home decor, decorating and well, all things related. A-Z &amp; in between. Problem is, I usually cannot afford (or more realistically I am too cheap to fork over the money) to pay for said obsession. You know...caviar taste with a tuna fish budget.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I adore transforming something old or outdated into a treasure, a masterpiece. Even more, I love when someone ( usually a man..except mine...he is trained better than that. Believe me? Good...more lies coming) tells me something cannot be done. \"Wait till 'he' can do it.\" Umm..no. I also have an extreme case of 'get out of my way &amp; watch me' and 'but..I want it NOW'. ( I am in therapy for that....it's all good.)This has resulted, over the years, in a lot of DIY. I mean...A LOT. A ton really.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Home decorating and 'domesticating' ( love that word, huh?) restores peace to my cluttered head. Whether it's inside or outside...if it's home related....I am all over it. I also use my weight in paint every year. No...for real. It covers a multitude of sins. Latex, oil based, spray....I am not discriminatory ....if it covers, I use it. It has been said by some, who know me well, that if you stand still next to me too long...you WILL be painted.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe our homes should reflect our personalities. Our spaces should bring us comfort, &amp; provide a refuge from the sometimes chaotic world we exist in. They should -- make.us.happy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Decorating, DIY &amp; creative reflection doesn't have to be hard, nor should we have to sell blood ( or a dog) to affford such outlets. Further, it doesn't have to be complicated!! Usually, all we need is a boost of confidence to set us on our way....a \" well really...if she can do it...ESPECIALLY her = then I totally can!\" I am here to do that!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Come with me, enter my little corner of the universe.We will explore life, struggles, triumphs. We will rant, share advice, recipes and often relate....&amp; we will decorate everything along the way!!&lt;\/p&gt;","headline":"Mrs. My Fairyality","tags":[{"tag":"Travel"},{"tag":"Gardening"}],"interests":[{"interest":"Home decorating"},{"interest":"Beach"},{"interest":"Parenting"},{"interest":"DIY"},{"interest":"Home"}],"locations":[],"schools":[],"jobs":[],"roles":[],"instagram_id":"517135289","instagram_username":"myfairyality","apps":[{"id":1,"platform":"instagram","display_name":"Instagram","display_order":1,"site_url":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/myfairyality","external":false,"expired":false,"has_edit":false,"has_remove":false}],"links":[],"featured_content":{"type":"blog","title":"My Fairyality","site_url":"http:\/\/myfairyality.com","feed_url":"http:\/\/myfairyality.com\/feed\/","display_name":"myfairyality.com","recent_posts":[{"content":"Welcome to the tour of our Christmas Village..which is the last installment of our Christmas Home Tour!!!
