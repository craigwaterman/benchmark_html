Well Spouse Caregivers:  Do You Ever Say, "Enough!"

<span style="font-family:arial;">The piece below is one reader's comments to my blog post about <a href="http://insicknessinhealth.blogspot.com/2007/12/story-about-chronic-back-pain-and.html">back pain</a>.  I post it here because I think she not only raises a crucial question about the caregiver's responsibility, but she does so with great awareness, openness, and articulateness.  And she is asking for support and advice.</span>  <span style="font-family:arial;">So please, if this piece speaks to you, help her out by sharing your experiences and ideas.</span> (btw - she gave me permission to repost her comments here)<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My husband and I have been married 18 years. He was in a car accident 12 years ago that left him with chronic back pain. After several surgeries he was left with a failed fusion. We seemed to muddle through our new life ok for a while. But as of late I see him diminishing so much mentally.<br /><br />We have two children that he simply does not have the "energy to parent" and my emotional needs were put on the back burner many years ago. I have voiced all of this to him repeatedly over the last three years but nothing seems to have the status that his pain has in his life.<br /><br />I am 38 and he has basically turned our bedroom into the extent of his accessible world. Recently he went past my limit and I had to ask him to leave. He has been living at another house for over a month. I just feel so empty of patience for him. I feel so uncomfortable about making him get out of his comfort zone. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But at what point do you just give up when your partner can not or will not see past their own nose?</span><br /><br />He is seeing a counselor and is on antidepressants since he left. He has always suffered from some level of depression but of course it is very severe at this time. He is upset with me that I am calling all the shots.<br /><br />However when someone withdraws form life like he has, they force you into that position. You become the only one that is able to fill the car up with gas or make appointments or pay bills. Every aspect of life outside the house becomes your area.<br /><br />I am wondering if between the medication, depression and pain (his counselor tells me that over time chronic pain patients brains can actually atrophy?) that he is just not capable of any husband responsibilities. And if that is the case what do you do with a man that is mobile but completely stagnant?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Is there anyone else out there on my side of the situation that has been married a long while still loves their spouse but is past lonely, past hurt, past frustrated? How are you dealing with it?</span>

Barbara, your poster is far from being alone in her plight. On the Well Spouse Association Forum (http://wellspouse.org/forums) the cry of &quot;Enough!&quot; is heard from many spousal caregivers.<br /><br />Back pain can be intractable and severe, and as such, can cause depression in the ill spouse. For myself, as a well spouse, I find depression in my ill partner to be much more difficult to handle emotionally than physical illness. I have to believe many other spousal caregivers feel that way too.<br /><br />The term &quot;well spouse&quot; really refers to a spousal caregiver who has done whatever they can to regain balance in their life, and to have some part of their life reserved for respite, and personal interests not involving caregiving.<br /><br />Your poster, it seems, was not able to achieve this balance with her husband. I am not sure whether he was treated for depression, or even if it could have helped.

CoDA  It&#39;s O.K. to look after yourself and your needs.  Healthy boundary drawing is essential to happy, healthy relationships.  Caretaking can also very much be enabling.

I recently lost my brother who had a stroke 3 years ago. His wife divorced him as soon a he got out of the hospital. She was not supportive from the beginning.I and others offered help but she refused -she just wanted out. The poster sounds much different. I would caution to not refuse and in fact, actively seek help in dealing with the ill spouse. He is hurting in more ways than one and will not understand abandonment. The poster will feel guilty as well for abandoning her husband-and rightfully so. He doesn&#39;t want to be this way. Unfortunately it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what to do. To start,involve others in the caregiving process. Some pain relieving strategies include an osteopathic manipulative therapist,aggressive and frequent professional massage therapy,an outstanding chiropractor,physical therapy and recreational therapy. If he refuses, do only what you can and keep your own life going. This doesn&#39;t have to involve abandonment.

I can definitely relate. My husband was left paraplegic in a car accident 6 years ago.  I love him so much but frequently I am so overwhelmed.  I have a very stressful job and two busy young children.  <br /><br />Care of the house, children, shopping,  homework, school meetings, and over all the ripping and running falls to me.  Most of the time I feel like an only parent.  It is rough.  <br /><br />For the first 5 1/2 years I wouldn&#39;t go off for too long (even on Saturdays) and going out of town was out of the question.  The guilt that I felt at &quot;having a life&quot; was and still is hard.  Even the children&#39;s lives have been stunted as a result of the accident.  Now, we go a &quot;little&quot; more - very little - and I worry the whole time I&#39;m gone.  I don&#39;t know what to do or how to cope with this.  Especially since I was always use to going places and doing things before the accident.  It&#39;s almost as if I was paralyzed at the same time he was 6years ago.  <br /><br />To make matters worse, I have a very active libido.  Of course, that part of our marriage ended at the point of impact.  Although most people won&#39;t believe it, I have remained faithful to my husband because of my love for him and God.  However, that doesn&#39;t that I have what I call my &quot;hot&quot; flashes.  <br /><br />Right now, I am so at the point of saying Enough is Enough!  But, by the grace of God and much prayer I am able to keep going.  God has preserved our marriage and I&#39;m grateful.

I have a husband who has been ill for 7 years now. He has chronic lung problems which doctors address the best they can. He has an infection that could be passed on to me. We live in the same house, but there is no intimacy or love. There is no physical contact and the conversation, if it exists, is only about the kids or informational. He is often moody, so to keep the peace I usually just go along with things and say nothing.  Best if I don&#39;t say anything than to say the wrong thing and get yelled at. He will often critize me in front of the kids. I work and try to take care of bills and the kids, never knowing when he will get worse. I long for a husband to just care for me. He blames me for our relationship failures, that it is my fault. How can I get away? I am so tired of being the &quot;good&quot; wife.

Thank you Richard, Debbie and Anonymous-es for your candid and thoughtful comments.  I find that learning about the commonalities, and especially the differences, in approaches helps me to expand my universe and be a more thoughtful partner to my caregiving spouse.

First off let me say that I am the ill spouse so my perspective is from that reality. When one spouse becomes ill or hurt, it is a no win situation.  Everyone cannot have their needs met it is impossible. There are so many issues and dynamics that need to be shifted and it takes a very long time for that shift to happen.  My husband and I almost didn&#39;t make it as many do not in this situation.  We now have a system that works for us and for the most part it is enough.<br /><br />For the early years in our marriage, my husband suffered with depression and I was the one to do the caretaking. But that is what a marriage is, give and take, in sickness and in health.  I wonder, if it was a child that became sick or injured how would the responses be different. It seems to me that if a child becomes sick no matter what the age, there is no question that the caretaking parent will move heaven and earth to take care of the child.  So why not the same with a spouse? I personally see no difference.

Thank you for your comment Melissa.  I think the point you make about marriage being about creating equilibrium as the sands shift from under you is an important one. And I admire the level of commitment you write about - that care of your spouse should be of the same degree as the care you would offer your child. Achieving that is another story for many.<br /><br />Also - your comment led me to your blog, and I thank you for that.  Your blog is amazing, and I hope others find their way to it.

I have been married for 22 years. After almost a year of constant complaining of stomach pain my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  The emotional and financial aspects of this situation are overwhelming.  I am hoping we don&#39;t lose our home and to boot I have three teenagers.  My husband is withdrawn and the only people he talks to are his sisters and his moma and brother.  I have no sexual or conversation with him.  He doesn&#39;t talk about anything and I feel dead with my eyes open.  I can&#39;t stand to hear him on the phone complaining about himself all the time.  I want to scream what about ME?  I then feel selfish but I feel like my live is over.  Does anyone relate to this.  I want to divorce but what type of person does that make me??

Anonymous - thank you for commenting with such honesty.  I can hear your scream over the internet and truly feel for your misery.  I think there are many people who wind up in desperate situations when it comes to dealing with an ill partner.  I can only urge you to find some support for yourself -- family, friends, or a therapist.  This is too hard a load to carry alone.

That is so very sad. Unfortuately, I am the ill partner of my marriage. The extra stress &amp; responsibility put upon my husband has been overwhelming. To make matters worse-before I became ill, I was the &quot;go-getter&quot; always taking care of any and everything. Now, I am capable of very little.<br /><br />I have horrible guilt, despite the fact that I did not intentionally become ill or do anything to cause it. The guilt has brought me to the point of offering to leave so that he could have the opportunity to have &quot;a normal life, and a normal relationship.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#39;t know what the answer to this issue is whether you are the ill or the well spouse-each has it&#39;s own frustration and pain. Incidently, my husband states that he loves me no matter what and does not want me to leave. That is not to say he copes well, as many times he doesn&#39;t and &quot;loses it.&quot; <br /><br />Bottom line: It is a tough situation for all parties and one that we so wish we could change...

I am the well caregiver, and my husband of 20 years has blood cancer. One year after the bone marrow transplant, he is now back to being pretty high functioning. While he was very ill and in the middle of the transplant, I had to send my young children to live with my sister, as his needs consumed all my time. I resented it then and honestly I still work on forgiveness. I try to remember to blame cancer, and not my husband. After most of the physical recovery, the depression and emotional recovery remained. I echo others&#39; sentiments when I say the emotional aftermath was far more difficult than the physical stuff. there were times when he was so mean, disrespectful, and baltantly unsafe with the children that I lived elsewhere, commuting in to care for the kids. Lots of therapy &amp; online support groups have helped and we now have a &#39;new normal.&#39; I am a wife and mother, but also a woman, and i have needs too. I try to forgive myself for doing what i&#39;ve done: sending my kids away, &amp; having a discrete affair. Best of luck to all of us as we struggle, this is a very hard situation with no easy answers.

I am the &quot;well&quot; caregiver and I can relate to several of your comments.  I can tell you that that the least of my worries is sexual...not even close.  I have a husband that has serveral chronic illnesses.  I am a strong committed woman and sad to say - I feel like I am being broken.  I too have reached a point that perhaps I need not be in the picture.  He is not happy with anything, he doesn&#39;t want to be compiant to help himself and is very arrogant and mean to our daughter of 22 who still lives at home as well as the animals.  We are in counseling.  He does not like to talk about what is happening.  He needs to have a rappore wtih at least two or three of his doctors to have his numbers monitored- unless prompted and even then...does not do.  He is enough to push me over the edge.  I have so much frustration and anger.  I am not angry because he is ill...I am angry because he does not and will not remove his blinders to see or take the time to learn or take the time to do!  If the man could understand that he is pushing away whatever family he has down to the dogs that it doesn&#39;t have to be this way!  Try to take each day at a time and enjoy what time you could possibly have left instead of pushing your loved ones away and making them feel guilty or better yet...so they don&#39;t even want to be with him.  I have done everything to help and it is killing me silently to watch him do this to himself because he doesn&#39;t care at all about anyone and most of all he doesn&#39;t care about himself

Gail - thanks for your open and articulate comments.   I&#39;m sure many caretakers will resonate with your words. It sounds like there is very little left in your relationship that provides you with nourishment.  I am sorry for that and for the resulting anger and emptiness.  I hope you are finding sources of connection and joy in other areas of your life - friends, family, animals. (btw -- do you know about Wellspouse.org ?)<br /><br />I wish you strength and sources of contentment.

gail, I can sort of relate.  My husband was in a serious car accident near twenty years ago.  Since then, he has had four hip replacements, etc.  He has not worked for four years, now.  I work really hard, physically at the job I do to keep us afloat.  In all of this time off, he has turned into an alcoholic.  He does absolutely nothing, and is physically and mentally suffering to a point that the doctor said that I should be prepared to call an ambulance at short notice.  He does not want to help himself, he has turned our son against him, and I am really scared about our finances.  He tells me nothing.  Is there any way that I can do this &quot;power of attorney thing&quot; I just don&#39;t know from day to day whether our power will be cut, the bills are paid, or Anything.

Tonight I stumbled upon this webpage.  I&#39;ve been married for 43 years.  In all those years, three were considered &quot;normal&quot;. When my husband was 30 years old he was given narcotics for an injury he had sustained and every since   prescription drug addiction has become the &quot;master&quot; of our home.<br />At 37 years old he was diagnosised with Rhuematoid arthritis which made it even  more convenient for him to abuse pain meds.  He has had every joint in his body replaced.  Now he is showing signs of mental illness.  Our children are grown and I am the only caregiver. For years I was hopeful he would get better, but now realize that at 71 years old he is an invalid. At times he can&#39;t feed himself, put on his clothing, clean himself.  At times he refuses to even try to do things for himself.   I&#39;m so tired physically and emotionally.  He acts so rude to the nursing staff when he goes to rehab, won&#39;t eat and unless I see him everyday, he becomes angry with me and aggressive towards the staff.   I doing my best to stay hopeful but each year it is getting more and more difficult. He tries to invoke guilt upon me if I complain of exhaustion.  I use to be able to get to church or shopping, now he gets questions my every move.   After reading the postings, I know that I am not alone and I must keep being hopeful that somehow, someday things will get better by the grace of God.

Married 36 years and the last 7 years my husbend has been a parapaligic due to a mass on his spinal cord. There are TWO victoms here. Him and I,  and I feel like I am paralized right in the middle of my life. I wish I were the one dying or dead. I was not happily married to him before  his surgery and I was waiting for the kids to at least be in college befor I left the marriage. Now I am stuck taking care of a man who hit me and verbaly abused me up until the day he got sick. Now I do it to myself because I am too much of a whimp to leave him. Thank you for letting me say this out loud, my mom died 6 years ago and I have no one to hear my pain. If you can relate to my situation please reply to carmen99@rocketmail.com

Anonymous - I am sorry that you are in such an untenable situation.  I don&#39;t see you as wimpy at all.  It takes huge fortitude just to deal as best we can with long term chronic care on top of all the rest life throws at us.<br /><br />I hope you do have other family or community support for yourself.  You need it and deserve it.  One online organization is http://www.wellspouse.org/<br /><br />I hope this new year brings you peace.

My husband and I were not so good before his illness.  Now, I am seeing the therapist. (I was told that I was sick in the head) Just trying to deal with the anger and stress of hanging on for the both of us. His limits are convenient to the extent of his desire to do whatever the task my be &amp; I completely understand that his pain is very much living thing that has a life of it&#39;s own. So there will be good days &amp; bad days. I have health problems of my own &amp; choose to embrace the good times &amp; build my strength for the bad days. He has made a choice to miserable which just absolutely pisses me off.  At this point he will say black if I say white. Because I dont know what he&#39;s going through. There&#39;s some truth to that.  I cannot understand the willingness to do nothing to change your situation.  Yes, he is depressed and refuses to take any medication or go the therapy, etc.  The doctor orders a test and he automatically states that it&#39;s too expensive and he doesnt want to go into debt. GRRRRRRR....

This comment from anonymous was mistakenly not posted. Here is is:<br /><br />I&#39;ve been married for nearly ten years now. Five years ago, my husband was diagnosed with epilepsy. <br />No one told me about the mental and emotional changes that would come with his seizures. He is n ot the man I married. He&#39;s moody, dismissive, self centered. He takes for granted that I&#39;ll be there, no matter what happens. He&#39;s emotionally abusive. He lacks empathy or compassion for me. Sometimes, basic respect is too much to ask. The change was so sudden, I thought I was imagining things. I&#39;ve found similar stories from other caregivers. The one thing I haven&#39;t found, is hope that it&#39;ll change. <br /><br />I try to remain steadfast, but he doesn&#39;t touch me unless its the three times a year that he wants sex and I miss affection. I miss kindness. I miss my husband. <br /><br />I don&#39;t know if I can stay much longer without being unfaithful. I&#39;ve begun telling myself that I only have to remain until the end of his life, because believing that this will eventually end his life actually helps me stay. I feel like s terrible person . . . Like I&#39;m hoping for it. <br /><br />No one will help me care for him. I already tried one to take my own life. I couldn&#39;t leave, but I couldn&#39;t stay. I love my husband. I just don&#39;t think I can live <br /><br />Posted by Anonymous<br />

I have been married for 19 years this August. My wife during most of that time has been complaining of this illness, or that illness, but mostly GI issues.  She has been tested for Crohns, Ciliac, and many others and all have come up negative.She still constantly complains of stomach pain and says things, in front of our children like &quot;It would be kinder if I just died.&quot;I don&#39;t think she is making her pain up; she has been diagnosed with high enzyme levels in her pancreas, Kidney Stones, and high blood pressure which the Doctor accounts on the pain.  because of her many allergies, there are few medications she can take for her pain. She is currently suffering from a Bladder infection but is allergic to every antibiotic used to treat it and the specialist can&#39;t get her in for a month. She is under 80 pounds. I AM SO FRUSTRATED! I know it isn&#39;t her fault, but I can&#39;t help being angry. I have 3 kids that need me to keep it together and I job that I have to keep since I am the family&#39;s only source of income.  I feel guilty for being resentful, but I am.  I just wish she wouldn&#39;t whine all the time and blame me for not caring, not helping, etc.... I often avoid being around her on purpose.  Thanks for letting me vent.

Sadly, it&#39;s not uncommon for the illness to wrap the couple relationship around it&#39;s nasty finger.  Illness, especially if pain and exhaustion are present, can consume way too much of your life force.   The ill partner can become focused on the illness, at the expense of relationships with partner, children and friends.  The well partner can become more and more remote as s/he tries to hold onto normalcy.  And both partners can wind up blaming each other - for everything.<br /><br />Underneath these scenarios run such deep fear and anger that often the couple avoids these feelings,  but at great cost.  It is natural to want to suppress such hurtful emotions - but they tend to seep out, and often in subversive ways.  How many of us have screamed at a jar lid that won&#39;t come off, or at a medication with side effects, or at a partner for not making it all better (even though both of you are trying as hard as you can).<br /><br />What can you do?  No easy answers here - because your situations are just not easy.  You can try directing your anger and fear at the illness; or sitting silently, side-by-side, and summoning your compassion for each other and your appreciation of the qualities you each possess.  You can try individual or couples therapy.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to ask you to try one thing.  That is -- be as compassionate and gentle as you can with yourself.  You are doing the best you can, every day.  If the illness has overtaken most of the kindness around you - it may sound cliche, but do try to be understanding and validating of yourself.  That too can become subversive and spread.

I have a couple different perspectives, I hope at least one can be helpful.<br /><br />My mom is depressed, and through the years kept retreating into herself further and further. She went from being an amazing woman to refusing to get out of bed &amp; needing to be told to take a shower. She wouldn&#39;t go to the dr or make an appt. My father did all the house &amp; yard work, child rearing, EVERYTHING. She was fully functional and simply refused to get help, to do anything. Dad was more than a single parent, he also had, in effect, a toddler who would never grow up.<br /><br />At what point is that enabling? What if he left and she HAD to do it by herself? She&#39;s certainly capable! What about HIS life? How is that fair to him? After nearly a decade, he started living his life to a degree. He would hang out with friends, but still be home on time to cook dinner &amp; run the household. After a couple years, my MOM ASKED HIM for a divorce-she felt &quot;abandoned&quot;. Two years have gone by &amp; she is still depressed, but shops, cooks, cleans, etc. Even has a couple friends. My father has his life back and couldn&#39;t be happier.<br /><br />I think the poster was completely right. Her husband was ABLE, but had withdrawn &amp; refused. By allowing it to continue, she was enabling him.<br /><br />I met my fiance 5 years ago. At the time I was healthy, aches and pains sometimes, but completely self sufficient. Two months later I went in for surgery. And then another. It still wasn&#39;t fixed. My body was getting worse, I needed severl surgeries on several joints. I was eventually diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder, my body would keep deteriorating and there was nothing we could do. We were dating less than a year &amp; I begged him to leave, he did not deserve a life as a care giver. I was stuck with this, but he had the whole world in front of him. He refused, swore to be by my side the whole way. Now my shoulder is fused and I&#39;ll never be able to move my arm again, I&#39;ve had multiple spine surgeries, I have three more surgeries lined up this year, and am in a wheelchair. He&#39;s been there through it all, taken on all of the household chores and helping me with basic care. I still tell him to leave  me, he proposed instead. What do we do differently? I insist on him being my FIANCE over being my caregiver. I appreciate everything he does. I INSIST he has time for himself &amp; that he go out with friends. When I&#39;m able, I do whatever chores I can. We spend time cuddling and *try* to have sex or care for each other in other ways. I&#39;m in therapy and on meds. I&#39;ve gotten him to consider therapy and I get him books on care giving and taking care of yourself first (can&#39;t give water from an empty well). I know I&#39;m not the only one affected, and while I didn&#39;t get a choice in the matter, he did - for that I am forever grateful and I&#39;ll never forget how much he lost and how much he does. <br /><br />Your poster&#39;s husband doesn&#39;t seem to have that understanding, doesn&#39;t appreciate her or try to do what he can. Since the husband isn&#39;t worried about her, she needs to be extra diligent in caring for herself. The burnout she experienced was inevitable with his behavior. She mentioned he is upset she is calling all the shots. If he&#39;s that upset, he should do something about it. Seeing a counselor/getting on meds is step one, but he needs to take control of his life, take responsibility for himself, his life, his happiness. He needs to appreciate his wife and all she has done - only then will their marriage work. Also, kicking him out of his comfort zone sounds like EXACTLY what he needed, like it or not. He found the ability to make an appt with a counselor and psychiatrist, to take care of himself - proof he was taking advantage and she was enabling while he was in the house. This should make her even more sure that she did the right thing - for herself AND for him.

You are all not alone. I feel sometimes that I have nothing else to give and have checked out emotionally. I stay with my husband because of our two boys. He suffers from chronic neck pain and barely holds on to his job. I feel so quilty fir feeling this way but I wonder what it would be like to be with someone healthy.....

My wife have been married for 43 years this month.  I have been her sole care giver since her stroke 10 years ago.  she has severe aphasia and needs full time assistance.  I&#39;ve been fortunate to be able to work from home and have always been here for her.  In sickness and health I will always take care of her. <br /> I have recently met a widow who was her huband&#39;s caregiver for several years. She was still mourning his loss after 2 years when we met. She has been very supportive and we have mutual sports, and activity interests. My 3 married daughters think that she has changed me from cynical and depressed old man to a &quot;real&quot; person again. She helps me care for my wife and the three of us are able to go out together for dinner, shopping etc.  <br /> Our friendship has become a love and we are still very sexual active.  I have found that she has helped me have a better attitude toward my wife and I am able to care for her without feeling burdened.  <br /> With her friendship with my daughters and wife I have no guilt in continuing this affair.<br /> We have a great relationship and I would never think of leaving eiher of the women in my life.

I have a severe arthritis in my neck, spinal stenosis with myelopathy and my husband is in denial.   The symptoms cause me to lose my balance, weakness in both legs, pain in back of neck and creeping paralysis.   I take only Aleve for the pain and use heating pads.  The treatment is surgery  (ACDF).  My husband is in denial, he tells me I am lazy and just need &quot;therapy.&quot;  He is not supportive, screams and yells when something is not done, etc.  I have had to cut my diet to avoid gaining weight since I can&#39;t walk too far due to my condition.  I am 5ft 4in, 140 lbs and above average in attractiveNess for my age, over 50.  I am well read, have a good sense of humor when he&#39;s not belittling me and doing the best I can.  I told him to call a lawyer if he hates being married to me so much.  He is making me lose the will to live, he is so condescending to me.  He has told me it was my imagination that I was experiencing neurological symptoms.   He can&#39;t deal with a less than perfect wife.  He says nasty things one minute and then he acts like nothing happened and wonders why I don&#39;t come to bed at night.  He has destroyed my self esteem.   I asked for nothing from him except understanding and support. <br /><br />At the end of my rope.  Never had suicidal ideation till this happened, he makes me feel worthess.

Anonymous - who has two special women in his life -- serious illness upsets all the balances in our main relationships.  It&#39;s a real testament to your commitment and caring that you have found a new balance that gives the energy you need to be the caring person you are.<br /><br />Anonymous - whose husband is mean to her -- clearly your relationship with your husband has ground you down.  And it&#39;s hard enough living with pain and impaired mobility!  It sounds like, in opposition to your husband&#39;s claims that you are &quot;lazy&quot; or that this is your &quot;imagination,&quot;  -- you are working extremely hard to cope with your condition and the toxicity in your relationship.  You need support - from friends, relatives, your community, a counselor.  You need someone on your side who can be a voice of love and compassion and understanding.  And it sounds like you also need some kind of emotional plexiglass shield to protect you from his &quot;nastiness.&quot;  And if you are thinking about suicide - that&#39;s understandable.  But if you are thinking about committing suicide , please, please seek help.  You are too important!<br /><br />I&#39;m not sensing this - but is it at all possible for your husband to get help (probably professional help) to better understand your health status, and to work through his own issues and feelings; and to get his own source of support?<br /><br />I wish you peace.<br /><br />

<p>
To those  who feel trapped and abused by finding yourself married to a person who is sick and disabled. I am so sorry.<br /><br />I would beg you to feel that you can leave the marriage without guilt.  No compassionate person- spouse, friend or family member- can legitimately fault you for changing your situation. There is no reason that two people have to suffer needlessly because one is disabled.  The sick spouse is not the person you married and not the person you planned your life with.  The huge change that has come to your disabled spouse has also come to you.  Neither of your lives will be what you planned.  <br /><br />Being sick brings out the whiny, shelf-absorbed parts of a person.  Hurting makes everything else of small importance. That is what the disabled person is thinking about.  You must do your own thinking.<br /><br />I give this advise from the sick bed. I have been chronically ill and disabled for 35 years.  My husband has stayed with me and supported me even though I was just becoming so sick that I was disabled, when he married me.  We didn&#39;t plan 35 years of my being ill.  For many years we thought that I would somehow recover, and I think my husband thought that I would die.  We were constantly talking, working and planning for my improvement. But that didn&#39;t happen.  Now, even though I am grateful that my husband has stayed with me, I wish he had not.  I feel the burden of having restricted his life.  He feels a great deal of resentment, but tries to hide it.  At the same time I have not ever adjusted to my disabled life.  I am still, 35 years later a dependent.  <br /><br />So what I am trying to say is that it does not end up good for either person. The sick person has to feel obliged that the other spouse doesn&#39;t leave. The sick person is always the person back in the bedroom, and has ceased to be a human being in his/her own right.  This leads to resentment.  The well spouse feels resentment for obvious reasons.  These are not issues that can be worked through or analyzed away.  They are in the very nature of the relationship.  That is in the best scenario.  Throw in personality disorders, addictions, children and financial problems and you have a time tested recipe for hell. <br /><br />Most of the time the caregiver is put in the roll without prior knowledge of  the changes it is going to involve.  The spouse becomes sick or disabled and that takes all of their attention.  Then, later, the caregiver realizes what position that has left him or her in.  <br />Right now, you should step back and evaluate the future.  Instead of just being pulled along you can look at the options now.  <br /><br />The options you have may be different than they seem.  You were stepping up to do what you had to do.  Now that you  know that this is a permanent or long term situation you need to get your breath, ask for help and try to get control of what is happening.  <br /><br />You can:<br /><br />-continue doing what you are doing, (maybe you are a natural caretaker and just need some help)<br />or -continue what you are doing with modifications (help, limits, conditions)<br />or -change the situation using a plan and in agreement with your spouse<br />or -walk away.<br /><br />First you need to really identify the problems. Then identify what is an acceptable solution.   Is the main problem that you are trying to live on one half the wages? or that you have no sex partner? or that you are constantly overworked? or that your sick spouse is mean? or all of the above?  Each one of these problems has a different potential solution.  Or are you saying - no.  I didn&#39;t sign up for this and I don&#39;t want to. That is ok.  No matter.  You can stop and change directions - your dependent spouse will end up thanking you.  With some creativity you can continue to have a relationship with your partner without the emotional and physical burdens.  <br /><br />Looking back and hearing, with tears, what you are saying, that is my advice.<br /><br /><br />

<dd class='profile-textblock'>In November, 1999 I was whacked with a mysterious chronic pain syndrome that took me out of my life.  With the help of my husband, my dog, and a combination of western and alternative  approaches, I have a new life that includes working, writing, mountain climbing, smiling, and managing pain.  I learned a lot along the way, especially about illness and the couple relationship.  I'm also a psychotherapist, a business consultant, and have written a book about couples and illness, which was published in March 2013 (Roundtree Press)</dd>

<span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&#8220;Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship.

Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.&#8221;<br/>Susan Sontag<br/></span>
