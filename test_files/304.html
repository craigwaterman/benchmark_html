I met Him in my friend Austenn's backyard, weekly. I met Him in my favorite coffee shop in Costa Mesa. I met Him on the 405 North in 4 pm traffic. I met Him in a noodle shop with Chloe. I met Him at the beach and in the mountains. I met Him walking away from a 17 year long commitment. I met Him when I was introduced to a new one. I met Him crossing the street in Beverly Hills.I met Him at Tru Bru with Kylie.&nbsp;I met Him in Alaska.&nbsp;I met Him at Whole Foods with Kelly. I met Him underneath the Huntington Beach Pier, twice. I met Him during an awkward meet and greet time at church in a girl named Ivory. I met Him at a concert in a tiny room, with too many people. I met Him at Target, for obvious reasons. I met Him singing in the car with my sister. I met Him at the top of Mount Rainier. I met Him in a conversation with my parents at Red Robin.&nbsp;I met Him in my Communications class.<em> I met Him daily.</em></p><p>I <em>am</em> meeting Him daily. Daily, He is putting people, things, opportunities in my path, saying "Hey I am Jesus and I want to know you."</p><p>Since I was in first grade, I understood who Jesus was, what He did for me and that I was supposed to know Him. So I did. I made the decision to know who He was. I knew who He was for seventeen years.</p><p>Today, I <em>know</em> Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, I know what it means to be <em>in relationship</em> with Him, outside of going to church and doing the right things and telling that kid in my class he probably shouldn't be doing the things he is doing. I know now that knowing Jesus means to kick it with the same Guy that John, the disciple, kicked it with thousands of years ago. I know now that knowing Jesus doesn't mean that I just get forgiveness, but that I get to be in friendship with The Forgiver. The best part of knowing Jesus, is that He knows me right back. He knows that I don't really like to sit in the middle of a row at the movies. He knows that I have a hard time letting people really know me because I am afraid they may leave me. He knows I probably won't be able to finish my Chipotle if there are too many pinto beans on it.</p><p>Jesus knows me better than the tangible human beings in my life,&nbsp;that I get to hang out with all the time. He knows me and He <em>chooses</em> to know me well. He knows the depths of me and He proves to me that He is going to stick around, always. He calls me friend, sister, daughter. He does not leave. He fulfills my deepest desires. He is meeting with me daily through the ordinary things. Every time I may stray a bit away from the rhythm of His heart, He introduces Himself to me and shows me how badly He wants to know me.</p><p>There is nothing more beautiful and wonderful and delightful that I have or will ever experience, than the gift of knowing Jesus and being known by Him.</p><p>My soul has found its worth through Christ.</p><p>He is faithful. He is kind. He knows me. He loves me. He sticks around.</p><p>It's CRAZY. I am blessed.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

It doesn't take much for me to get excited and once I have something to be excited about, I take it and RUN with it. In fact The Enneagram Test (a personality typing system that consists of 9 different types), calls me The Enthusiast. The Enneagram Institute describes people like me like this: "They are enthusiastic about almost everything that catches their attention. They approach life with curiosity, optimism and a sense of adventure, like 'kids in a candy store' who look at the world in wide-eyed, rapt anticipation of all the good things they are about to experience. They are bold and vivacious, pursuing what they want in life with a cheerful determination." So yeah, I get excited about EVERYTHING.&nbsp;</p><p>Being someone who gets overly invested in everything, seeps into every single aspect of my life. So, when it came to figuring out what I want to do with my life, within this next year and even where I see myself in ten years, you could say I was <em>all in</em>. About three years ago I figured out what I see myself doing career-wise and basically life-wise for the rest of my life. After figuring these things out, I started to put <em>everything </em>into trying to get there. Every single day was about "well I have to do this in order to get to do this."&nbsp;My entire life became focused on this one call I felt and it has been that way since the day, THREE YEARS AGO (we are talking over 1000 days of determination), that I figured out what God was calling my future to be. I was excited.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with determination or having a desire to go places with your life. Actually, both of these things are imperative to being a normal human being. I hope for you that you have a constant desire to grow and to be better and to get to the places you need to be. But, I have to tell you where I went wrong in the process of being a dreamer. That is all I was and all I was becoming; a dreamer. The entirety of my day to day life was focused on getting out of Orange County, California and getting to pursue the career that I still feel so called to. I got so caught up in the things God was calling me to for the future, that I forgot to listen to my daily call. My daily call is to today, this hour, this minute, the girl sitting next to me in this coffee shop, the time I spend in The Word, the songs I sing in the car with my best friends, this very second. <em>These</em> are the things God is calling me to right now.&nbsp;</p><p>As a follower of Jesus, my call is to ministry. Jesus calls us into ministry every single day. That doesn't mean being on your church staff or being on the streets of Los Angeles everyday, although these are both great forms of ministry. A call to ministry is a call to service and to love, daily. The city in which I live, right now, is my mission field. I may not live here my entire life. I may have no desire to live here right now. But, God is calling me to today and to living fully and completely in His grace and goodness in Orange County.</p><p>So I am working on it. I'm working on knowing what God has planned for me in the future, while also knowing what He has for me today. It's hard. I am <em>really </em>excited about this next year. I know that November 15, 2016 is going to look massively different than what November 15, 2015 looks like and that makes me squeal and want to dance because I cannot wait for the future to become the present. But today is today. This is where I am. This is where I am called right now. I'm learning still how to be content with that, but I know that God is using me where I am at and I cannot limit His goodness by telling myself this is not where I am supposed to be.</p><p> </p><p>Side Note:</p><p>Remember in the first paragraph when I pulled that quote from a website that knew more about my personality than I myself know? I am assuming you probably want to know things about yourself too.&nbsp;</p><p>You can take a free Enneagram Test here: &nbsp;http://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test.php</p><p>You can research what your results mean here: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/</p><p>Let me know what personality type you are!</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I have been struggling with an anxiety disorder for about six years now, but it wasn't until about 9 months ago that I was actually diagnosed by a doctor. The reality of my condition is that I have to take multiple medications daily, in order to live a "normal life", and a lot of times (most times actually) that doesn't help me at all. It sucks. I'm serious. It really really sucks. I wake up and I feel like I would rather stay in bed all day because that would mean I didn't have to face the world. It takes a toll on my relationships, my school work, my ability to make commitments, etc. I am terrified of the idea that I may not be able to leave a situation. It feeds into every single aspect of my life and makes easy things difficult, and difficult things even more difficult.</p><p>But I'm not here to tell you about why my life sucks, it doesn't. I am not here to tell you about my fears of facing the world. I'm here to tell you about the hope I have in Christ. If you've ever dealt with anxiety, you know it comes in waves. I can go a couple days without an anxiety attack and feel great and hopeful and like I can take on anything. Then theres days, like these past three, where I feel horrible and I feel stuck and I feel like its never going to end. I turn to God and I tell Him my frustrations. I ask Him brutal questions that no father would ever want to hear their daughter ask; questions like "Why can't I live a normal life?" "Why won't you fix me?" "Why won't this ever end?". And God looks at me and He says the same thing Christ said in His final breath, "It is finished." He looks at me and calls me daughter. He reminds me that when His son went to the cross He took all my fears, and all my failures, and every single one of my worries with Him on the cross and He finished them.</p><p>Work with me here because communicating this verbally hasn't been the easiest and I am trying to find a way to talk about it that makes sense. But friends, I want you to know that, here in the hardest season of my life, I have hope. I have hope because the moments I am in, the painful ones that I feel like are never going to end, are finished by Christ. He put an end to those things the day that He walked the cross up those hills, with me in mind. Unfortunately, because of this sinful world we live in, I'm going to go through sucky times (we all are). The great news is, there is an end, and the end is Christ. There is hope and there is refreshment and there is comfort and there is peace.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not writing this for attention or for sympathy, actually that is the last thing that I want. I am writing this because I know how pressing mental illness is on this world we live in, and especially on people my age. So I want you all to know, there is hope, you're not alone, and that you can find freedom in Christ. And I am not saying that the second you say "God take away my anxiety" that it is going to happen. That isn't what I am trying to say at all. But, what I am trying to say is that you are loved and Christ wants to embrace you in your times of anxiousness or depression or whatever it may be that you are going through.</p><p>Thank you for listening to the rambles of my heart. This is probably one of the least put together blog posts I have ever posted, but there is no beautiful or easy way to talk about such a pressing thing.</p><p>If you have questions or if you are dealing with a similar situation, head over to the "Contact Me" page and I will be more than willing to respond to your emails about whatever it is you want to know or need to hear.</p><p>You are loved and treasured,</p><p>Danielle</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

So, today I did that. I thought about succulents and the way you only have to water them a couple times and they still stay alive. They need no attention. They stand beautiful on their own. They are given nothing but a little light, yet&nbsp;they live.</p><p>What if we lived like succulents? (Ugh, I can't write this without feeling like a pretentious hipster Instagram mom.) What if we required nothing but a little bit of light in order to still live? Now obviously, this takes a little imagination, because anyone who went to first grade knows that food and water are necessary to live. I'm not talking about physical living though. I'm talking about spiritual living; allowing our souls to live without depending on anything except ourselves and that little bit of light.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see where this is going? I know you probably do.</p><p>Light = Jesus.</p><p>Succulent = Me.</p><p>Life is good because that is all it takes. All it takes is Jesus, to live a full, whole, fruitful life.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait.. There's more. Remember about three sentences in when I talked about how you have to water succulents every once and a while? You don't have to water them very often because they hold water and it stays within them. What could that water possibly symbolize? (my favorite thing that you all know I love) Community!!!</p><p>In order to live fully,&nbsp;we also need a community to pour into us, to stick with us.</p><p>LIFE IS GOOD. WE ARE LIKE PLANTS AND THAT IS SO COOL.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

This&nbsp;has lead to me getting the opportunity to know and learn about the depths of who the people in my life are. One of my favorite ways to get to know a person is to whip out my list of questions to ask people consisting&nbsp;of about 80 questions that help me learn about who someone is. It is full of weird, fun, and some serious questions that vary from "Do you relate more to Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?", "It's Thursday, what are you eating for lunch?" and "Have you ever been in love?"</p><p>Asking questions has become my new favorite pastime. My silly game of questions has lead me to start thinking about the importance of investigating other areas of my life, just as much as I investigate the people in my life's lives. I realized that I can't get answers unless I ask questions; ask myself questions, ask God questions, ask my mentors questions etc.</p><p>A friend of mine is the biggest believer in asking questions. He is constantly pushing me to ask and think and let myself learn. He encourages me to not just keep my thoughts in my head, but to investigate and find out what I can, but also to be okay with not always having the answers. So, I've been doing that. I have been learning and growing and thriving to find answers.</p><p>Learning about myself and God through the art of asking questions has been one of the most rewarding things lately in my life. The whole point of this short little post is just to encourage you to start asking more questions.</p><p>I want to leave you with some questions to ask, so you can get the idea of what it's like to live a life full of investigation and searching for truth:</p><p><strong>Ask your Friends:</strong> How are you?; Would you rather be best friends with Justin Timberlake or be able to understand dogs thoughts?; What's your latest Netflix binge?</p><p><strong>Ask Your Mentors:&nbsp;</strong>What have you been learning lately?; Is there anything you think I could work on as a human being?; What do you believe the purpose of life is?</p><p><strong>Ask God:&nbsp;</strong>What's on your heart for me today?; Why is ___________ happening in my life lately? What is your plan for that situation?; Why is California weather so weird lately?</p><p><strong>Ask questions. There is no wrong thing to ask. You can ask that.</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

My community was there. My heart was there. My service was there. Everything I had, was there. That church was the main reason that I had a thriving Christian community. All of my closest and lasting friendships were introduced to me within that church. After attending regularly for 17 years, I felt God tugging on my heart and urging me to go somewhere else; telling me that there was something more out there for me that would provide more growth than I was already getting. That terrified me.</p><p>This is why:</p><p>The basis of my friendships was the physical location that we all continuously went to,&nbsp;the church. I was scared that once I left, my friends would have no reason to be my friends. My mentors would have no reason to mentor me. My pastors would have no reason to pastor me. If I left, would they leave me?&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of the situation is, sadly, some of this became true. My friendships that were so deeply rooted in Jesus lasted. My friendships that were deeply rooted in the church faded. That process, though hard, taught me a ton about community and unity between churches. I learned that a church community isn't real if when you take away the church,&nbsp;the community disappears too.&nbsp;</p><p>As I processed the transition I was going through, I started to think a ton about God's intention for the church and the way He calls us to be united through the Spirit. No matter what building we decide to sit in on Sundays, Jesus wants us to love each other and be in relationship with each other. Our love for each other should not be limited by where we choose to go to church. The Church is more than a building; it is a working, moving, serving, relational body of Christ. We are united through Him and it is Him that should be the foundation of our relationships.</p><p>What I want to leave you with is this:</p><p>If someone in your life chooses to switch&nbsp;churches, remember that doesn't change the fact that they are part of The Church; the Body of Christ. Stop asking why and trying to convince people that they are making the wrong decision. Instead, find depth in the questions of "How is Jesus working in your heart since you've decided to make this transition?"&nbsp;or "What have you been learning?" or "How are you?"&nbsp;Your intention should be love, always. It is not the building that we stand in, but the God we worship that unites us as a church community. We are all in this together.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe that's just me though... I have spent a fair amount of time on my computer watching these ridiculously relevant videos making fun of myself. One of the ones that really gets me is the montage of the question "What's on your heart?" being asked over and over again, because I know I am that person.</p><p>All jokes aside, the question of "What's on your heart?" is one of the most vulnerable questions that you can ask, and leaves a ton of room for impact and influence. In some ways, I think that the person asking the question actually benefits more than the person answering it. When someone shares the depths of their hearts with you, it allows you to be a part of the process in which your friend is learning, growing and thinking.</p><p>For the past couple months, I've been trying to treat Jesus more as a friend than a distant idea. Part of that process has been being in constant communication with Him. In other words, I try to pray constantly. Often times I find myself telling God so much that I don't leave any room for Him to communicate with me. I don't ask Him about Himself. I don't ask Him about His Heart. So that's what I have been trying to do lately. I try to start my day by asking God the same question that I constantly find myself asking my friends; "What is on your heart?". Simply asking Jesus to show me what, or even who, is on His heart has made a drastic change in my life. When we invite Jesus to be the savior of our lives, we aren't inviting Him to work with us, on our own agenda, we are inviting Him to work <em>through</em> us. By asking God to show me what is on His heart through out my day, I am allowing God to work through me in new ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe God has that girl you pass by every single day and never say a word to on His heart. Maybe God has a specific charity or serve project on His heart. You won't know until you ask! Invite God to work through you by starting your day off with the question, "What's on your heart today?" and see what He does. I promise you He will do really cool things.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

They are constantly giving me the best advice ever and I am so incredibly thankful for that. I want you all to have the opportunity to hear some advice that they have, so I decided to make this blog post a little bit different than usual.</p><p>Here's what my friends and family had to say when I asked them the following question</p><h2>"If you could give one piece of advice to the human race what would it be?"</h2><p>"Listen more, speak less." - Emily Lebs</p><p>"Know Jesus and love Him and His people with everything in you and more." - Chloe Jarrett</p><p>"<span>A lot of people feel forced to follow these strict guidelines to succeed in life and make it big, &amp; when you don’t follow those guidelines, you almost feel like you’re doing the wrong thing because everyone treats you like you are. I guess I want to encourage people to realize that none of that really matters &amp; it may feel like the end of the world if you’re doing something that isn’t necessarily what people were hoping for you, but if you don't want to do something because you aren’t passionate about it then don’t do it, and&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;really love doing something and feel passionate about it then pursue that with everything you have." &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;-Eddie Rios</span></p><p>"Love God. Love people. Stay humble. Seek wisdom. Have fun. Be bold. Stay faithful." -Colton Harker</p><p>"Don't take yourself so seriously. You will miss out on life." - Bryce Kelley</p><p>"Challenge yourself; whether it's reading more, working out, or becoming an expert on something meaningless like constellations or Star Wars." -Justin Brewer</p><p>"Everyone on God's green earth will feel alone at some point or another in their life. Everyone will suffer through pain. Everyone will cry. Everyone will go through what feels like the depths of hell... When these moments hit you know this: these moments do not make you inadequate or lesser than, they make you human. And however dark and dreary these moments seem, don't ever give up. When these moments hit you, hit back harder. Ultimately it is up to you and only you whether you will make it out the other side. Find what it is that will bring you joy and never stop fighting for it. Fight for your happiness and fight so that you might make the struggle a little less daunting for those around you." -Adam Day</p><p>"Love God. Love others. Stay Curious. Try all the chai (particularly the chai from Intelligentsia)." &nbsp; - Emily Arnold</p><p>"Don't be afraid to ask questions. But don't be afraid to not have answers either. Some of the most invigorating things in life, the things that dare to define our humanity, are not definitions but instead unashamed inquiries into what humanness is or can dream to be." -Eric Robinson</p><p>"It's not about finding yourself, it's about creating yourself." -Cole Johnston</p><p><span>"In every stage of your life, choose joy.&nbsp;Joy is not something you can achieve or earn. It is given to you&nbsp;by God. Joy is a state of being, a mindset. Joy means that&nbsp;even if there are things that don't make you happy, you can still be joyful." -Matt Gaydos</span></p><p><span>"You can restart your day whenever you want. Just because it starts out bad, doesn't mean it has to stay that way. Pray, take some deep breaths and start your day over. Remember that no matter what the weather is or how full you feel, there is always room for ice cream." -Christa Martin</span></p><p>"Everywhere Jesus went he interacted with people with grace, truth, humility, and love and people of all types were attracted to Him. They were drawn to Him. Show those things in your life and people will see God in you." -Justin Knowles</p><p><span>"In anything we do in life, balance will bring happiness and success. &nbsp;Unfortunately it is hard to maintain balance and many take the easy path and fall to one extreme or another. Those who surrender to an unbalanced life wonder why so much has gone awry." -Rich Martin</span></p><p><span>"If you hate your job, quit." -Kathy Martin</span></p><p>I thought I would throw in a piece of advice of my own:</p><p><span>Life doesn't start the day you graduate or the day you get married, it starts when you decide it does. Start living now. Live passionately. Love deeply. Continue to learn about yourself. Always have 5 dollars in your car in case you need to buy a Little Ceasers pizza. Most importantly, always remember that you will never influence the world trying to be like it.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I create traditions with myself.</p><p>I make sure to love myself as much as possible. I always convince myself that I deserve to be kind to myself, because I do. I work hard. I wake up really early every day. I go to school, even though most of the time I feel like it is the biggest waste of time ever. I've found that if I don't take time to reward myself, I get really caught up in life.&nbsp;</p><p>So here's what I am going to challenge you to do. Take yourself on a date. Go to the beach with yourself. Go to your favorite coffee shop and let your date be that book you bought three weeks ago and haven't taken off the shelf since it left it's Barnes and Noble bag. Go through the Mcdonald's drive through and buy yourself fries. Sit in the parking lot and eat those fries listening to your favorite song on repeat 16 times through. Buy that shiny golden stapler for 15 dollars instead of the boring black one for $10. Go to Target with the intention of buying yourself something nice. Make every Saturday the day that you go eat a bagel. (Bagel Saturday is the best part of my week, every week.)&nbsp;Treat Yourself. It doesn't have to be a big thing, it doesn't have to be a small thing. Just remind yourself that you deserve it. Remind yourself that you love you.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to hear about how you are treating yourself!

I have been a bit absent lately.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't think anyone cared that I wasn't posting. I honestly thought nobody was reading this blog of mine, so I didn't think that it would be a problem if I didn't post for a while. Until recently, when I ran into some old friends at Chipotle. (Shout out to Tori and Tara! It was so fun seeing you two!)&nbsp;I was chatting with them and catching up a bit, when they mentioned that they both read my blog and that sometimes when they check and see that there's no new post up, it bums them out.</p><p>First of all, it was absolutely insane to me that a couple girls who I haven't talked to since I was twelve were reading my blog. Second of all, it's just crazy to me that people are reading my blog.&nbsp;</p><p>Being completely honest with you, I have had a total lack of inspiration and energy lately. I am exhausted and sitting down to write a blog post is the last thing that I know how to do. I don't know what to write about, and it's so much easier to open up my laptop to a new episode of Friends than it is to write about something that I am not totally and completely passionate about. For the longest time I didn't think anyone was reading. It made me sad and made me feel like I was doing this for nothing, that the words that I was writing didn't matter. Now I know that they do. I have a new passion that's been ignited in me for writing.&nbsp;</p><p>The point of this post is to tell you that I was uninspired and tired and didn't think anyone was listening. Now I know that's not true, and I am feeling so inspired and I've discovered the work that coffee can do in my life. I am sorry for being absent. There are posts coming. New things. New places. New ideas.</p><p>It's going to be great. Thanks for hanging in there. You all mean a lot to me. Seriously.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

For some reason, I convinced myself that I am an athlete (which I totally am not) and decided that I'm going to start running around our local lake every day. When I first started running, I got really frustrated with myself. I was getting really out of breath and exhausted after running short distances. I didn't understand why I couldn't run further and I wanted to give up, until a random man at the lake told me to "Slow it down!" while I was running. I listened to him. I started running slower. I learned how to pace myself. I no longer felt worn out and run down after the first five minutes of my run. I wasn't in a race with myself anymore. I was just running. After figuring out how to pace myself, I've been able to run 5 miles (which is a ton for a non-athlete like me). I am enjoying running so much more now. I am taking in the beauty around me and instead of thinking about the next corner I have to run around, I am just thinking about what is happening in the moment that I am in.</p><p>Okay, so now that I've made myself sound way more sporty and cool than I actually am, let me tell you about what that random man at the lake taught me about life. I realized I've been running way too fast. I'm sure you've figured out that I'm no longer talking about actual running. I have been constantly focused on the next thing I have to do. My life has been a constant check list of who I need to call, what time I have to leave in order to have time to stop at Starbucks on the way to work, what I need to pick up at Target, and am I ever going to get a carwash? I've worn myself out. I'm exhausted. I couldn't figure out why. I was enjoying all the things that I was doing, so why was I so tired of doing all of it?<em> I wasn't pacing myself.&nbsp;</em>Just like the man at the lake said, "Slow it down!". That's all it took for me to completely 180 the way I was feeling about life. I don't need to race myself. I am not in a race with anyone. I've slowed it down and I go to sleep feeling confident that the things that should be done, will get done, eventually. I take myself on dates and I eat french fries in the car alone. I hang out with friends because I want to, not because I feel obligated to. I write blog posts when I feel inspired, instead of staring at my computer screen scared of disappointing people.</p><p>Wake up and tell yourself to "Slow it down". I promise it will make a significant change in the way you live and breathe and feel and love. Be in the moment that you are in and find peace in the fact that eventually you will make it around the next corner. Keep the pace.</p><p><em>Slow it down. Slow it down. Slow it down.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

(and to you, Mom. I know you LOVE your emojis).</p><p>Recently I was in a conversation (via text) with someone who was using a ton of unnecessary emojis. Don't get me wrong, I think they're fun, but did that sentence about you having to go take a shower really need to be followed by a *crying laughing emoji* and a *bath tub emoji*?&nbsp;</p><p>I started thinking about emojis a lot after being overwhelmed at the amount of yellow faces popping up in my text messages. I googled what their purpose is and this is what came up:</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>"</em><em><span style="font-size:15px">They're a way to say something to someone when you don't have anything to say, a digital alter ego"</span></em></p><p style="margin-left:480px"><em><span style="font-size:15px">Source: Huffington Post</span></em></p><p>After conversing for a while with a lot of people that use a ton of emojis in conversation, I started to become really aware of my emoji usage. What was I using emojis for? Do my emojis really mean anything? I found myself replying to kind compliments solely with a *heart emoji* and expressing happiness through a *wide smile emoji* instead of actually explaining and showing true genuine feeling.</p><p>Obviously, there is such thing as human interaction and it shouldn't be replaced by technology, but there is no denying that social media and text messaging has become a fundamental part of the way we communicate these days. But, that doesn't mean that we have to completely stop expressing emotions using words. I'm a big believer in transparency and being real and have found that emojis have become a very easy way to hide behind a cute little yellow face instead of coming to terms with and expressing what a person is actually feeling.</p><p>Since my process of realization has begun, I have turned my emoji keyboard off on my phone. I no longer have the ability to reply with a *sad face emoji* when someone tells me that they have to cancel on our plans. I have to tell them I am sad. I have to tell them why I am sad. In the grand scheme of things, I am sure that means a lot more to them than just getting a sad face in return. If it was me I would think "wow, this person really did want to hang out with me and she really is bummed that we can't hang out" instead of "Well I am glad that she wasn't that upset, I guess."</p><p>Being emoji-less is helping me to come to terms with how I am actually feeling and helping other people understand what I am feeling too. It's a process and I can't tell you how many times I have went to click the emoji keyboard only to find that it isn't there and get frustrated with myself thinking "How am I going to say that in words?", but its been rewarding to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm saying goodbye to my "digital alter ego".</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

That's art.&nbsp;</p><p>I recently got my hands on some donut stationary. YES, it is as wonderful as it sounds: stationary that is covered in different pictures of donuts ranging from jelly filled to rainbow sprinkle. It is magic. Anyways, I got this donut stationary to maybe encourage myself to write to people on their birthdays or say thank you when they do something kind. But it quickly went from a convenient thing to something that I loved doing.</p><p>I have friends all over the country: Utah, Texas, Michigan, Northern California, Washington, etc. (College takes my friends from me it's very sad, but that's besides the point) I'm pretty good at keeping in contact and in the loop with my friends via social media and texting, but being able to write letters to them has changed things a ton for me. Whether it be a letter of encouragement or a letter with a full and complete update on my life, writing letters has become special to me. I am learning so much about myself&nbsp;and&nbsp;my friends.</p><p>Writing letters of encouragement has given me the opportunity to sit and reflect on how blessed I am to know the people that I know. There is something about putting pen to paper and really considering what a human means to me that puts things in perspective for me. Also, it doesn't hurt to receive a letter back or a text letting me know how loved and encouraged they felt by receiving a letter from me. It feels like I'm giving back to them a little bit for loving me so well.</p><p>I've learned to love updating people on my life because of one of my best friends, Emily. She's doing a really cool bible program in a place that doesn't really have cell service so our only way of contacting each other is via Facebook messaging or writing letters. About once a month, we will send a letter to each other giving all the details of our lives as of late, highs and lows. It is an incredible thing to be able to write out every single thing going on in my life. It's a time of reflection for me and helps me process what has been going on in my life.</p><p>Writing letters to people is teaching me so many new things. I never thought I would feel rewarded by something that I am sending to someone else. I so so encourage you all to go to Target or maybe even spend a little money and check out papersource.com and get some stationary. Start writing letters. Start loving people via paper. It's been my favorite thing lately.</p><p>I read a cool article on a blog I love, called Converge,&nbsp;about 10 different kinds of letters you should write. Check it out <a target="_blank" href="http://convergemagazine.com/10-letters-write-honour-universal-letter-writing-week-15509/">here</a>.</p><p>Get writing!</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

(even though, believe me, I am doing that and loving it.) I'm talking the <em>I am living a routine life and nothing exciting is happening because I am so comfortable in what I am already doing that I've failed to let myself do anything new</em> kind of comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>Every single day I wake up and do the exact same thing. Tuesdays and Wednesdays I go to bible study, Saturdays and Sundays I go to work. I hang out with the same friends, in the same places, doing the same things. I eat the same things and watch the same shows. Now these all may seem to be minor things, but they build up into a routine; a very comfortable routine.</p><p>I've been thinking a lot about where God works into this mix. How does He fit into my routine? Yes, Tuesdays and Wednesdays I'm going to bible study and I do work at a church, so I'm spending Saturdays and Sundays with Him too. But, I realized that the second I got into a routine, was the second I stopped growing. There's been tons of opportunities that I have turned down because I didn't want to sacrifice my routine. How is it possible to let God do work in my life when every time I feel called out of my comfort zone I don't follow that call?</p><p><span>God’s all about ripping people out of their comfort zones in order to do something great in their hearts. I’m realizing that surrender isn’t really a sacrifice at all. It’s more of a safe place; knowing that following God’s call, even if it absolutely terrifies you, will land you in a place of promise and purpose.</span>&nbsp;I'm trying hard to adapt this to my life. No more routine. No more comfort. The second I become comfortable is the second that I begin to put limitations on God's ability to use me.</p><p>God is not a comfortable God.</p><p><em>Ps. I apologize for this being a little bit ranty and all over the place.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

(12 days of 2015! It seems to be flying by.) January is always full of new goals, new motivation and inspiring Instagram posts telling you to "Be the best you that you can be this year!" followed by an unrealistic goal of getting down to your&nbsp;goal weight, your birth weight. (joke. laugh.)</p><p>This January is different for me. I was scrolling twitter on New Years Eve when I came across a tweet from the smartest 15 year old that I know that said "Why does everyone think they need a new year in order to change their life?" It got me thinking. I've never been the kind of person to answer "Do you have any New Years Resolutions?" with "I don't believe in New Years Resolutions."&nbsp;But I have to admit something, I don't think I believe in New Years Resolutions anymore.</p><p>This year I sat down and put together a list of things I wanted to continue to do this year, just maybe a little bit better. I know myself, and I know that changing just for the sake of changing&nbsp;isn't something I'm good at. I often lose motivation, interest or just forget about it in general. Not following through with things feels like failure to me, and failure is not something that I want for myself. Instead of thinking about all the things I didn't do in 2014 and should be doing in 2015, I decided to recognize the good things I did and encourage myself to keep doing those things, just a little bit better/more (and blog about the process.).</p><p>Here's a peak into my journal. (Please excuse my sloppy hand writing and attempt to be artsy.)</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1420501265000_31866"><div class="sqs-block-content">

It's one of our favorite places to go as a family and we always have a great time. One of our traditions is that we always stop by the "HE&gt;i" store. If you haven't heard of this company, they're great and they're all about promoting that God is greater than ourselves. Last year I decided to buy a "HE&gt;i" sticker to put on my car. I love the message and thought it would be something I would want to promote on my car all the time.</p><p>Fast forward to about a week ago (I just sang that in my head. I hope someone gets that reference.)//</p><p>I was driving in the car with my sister on the way to Subway, and we got to chatting about the fact that I have some terrible driving habits. I'm ashamed to admit&nbsp;I am THAT person that speeds up to pass the person who is going the speed limit and most likely have cut off more people and stolen more parking spots&nbsp;than I am even aware of. (Mom, Dad. I am SO sorry.) I then made a joke about how I should probably take the "HE&gt;i" sticker off of my car because my driving doesn't represent Jesus very well.</p><p>Although I was joking (but I would be lying if I said I haven't considered removing the sticker for this reason), I didn't realize what I had just said until my sister responded to my comment with a very genuine, "Well why don't you just change the way you drive?"</p><p>It got me thinking. If the concept of "HE&gt;i" is something I truly believe in, why was I willing to remove a sticker instead of change something in order to stay true to that? Are there other things in my life that I am "removing the sticker" from because I would rather do what I want to do than what God would want me to do? What kind of sacrifices am I making for myself, when I should be making them for Jesus?</p><p>It all comes back to exactly what the sticker (that is absolutely still there) on my car says. HE&gt;i. God is greater than myself. Following Jesus means completely putting my own selfish desires aside and fully following Him and what He wants from me.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button" data-block-type="53" id="block-yui_3_17_2_6_1420771690080_6055"><div class="sqs-block-content">

I love lists, and I make them for everything. To give you an idea, here's a little sneak peak at what you would find if you were to open up my Notes app on my phone:</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Nice Things People Said (A list of all the nice things people have said to me.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Things To Remember (A list of things I need to remember.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>The Dani Dictionary (A list of all the words I say WAY too much.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Things To Watch (A list of over 100 movies and TV shows to watch.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Foods To Try (A list of yummy recipes. I've never actually made any of them.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Reasons To Love My Dad (A list of reasons to love my dad.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Reasons To Love Mondays (A list of reasons to love Mondays.)</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Things I know About Myself (A list of all the things I know about myself.)</em></p><p>My favorite list of them all, the list&nbsp;that crunches all lists, is my Things I Know About Myself list.</p><p>I started that list about four months ago after a friend suggested I do so, and let me tell you folks, there were a lot of things that I didn't know about myself until I started this list. The list now contains over 400 (and counting) different bullet points of things that I know about myself, all being written down as I learn them.</p><p>Before this list I had no idea that if there are too many pinto beans on my Chipotle burrito, I won't eat it. I had no idea that when people apologize for not responding to texts, it makes me feel more loved than getting a response in the first place. I didn't know the importance time had to me. I didn't know that Diet Coke is my jam (okay, totally knew that and totally just threw it in because you guys need to understand my love for Diet Coke. Please withhold all comments about how damaging it is to my body.)</p><p>Anyways, what I'm getting at is that we are constantly learning and growing, not only about the world, but about ourselves. I think that a lot of times the little things we learn about ourselves get overlooked and we don't even realize them until we stop and think "Oh, I have a very weird passion for Adele." or "Oh I let my happiness depend too much on other people." I now have a list of over 400 things that I have learned about myself in the past couple months, and it just keeps growing.</p><p>This is my encouragement to you:</p><p style="margin-left:40px">It's 2015. Learn about yourself in 2015. You are going to transform in more ways than you could possibly recognize without writing those things down. Start a new Note in your Notes section. Heck, spend a few dollars at Target on a new journal and create an entire journal of things you know about yourself. <strong>Get to know yourself this year.</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
