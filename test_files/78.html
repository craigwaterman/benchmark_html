<p style="text-align: left;">Do you wonder: is your alcoholic husband normal or not?  Are your important memories ruined by his bad habits?  Are you feeling jealous and resentful of other friends and family that seem to have it so much better than you?</p>
<p>I remember feeling that way too.  When my son was born my husband was too sick to even show up at the hospital.  All the nurses assumed my Dad was the father. One of the happiest times of my life became one of the most disappointing and hurtful moments.  There was no more denying that he had major issues.  But we do deny sometimes, don’t we? We allow ourselves to think this craziness is normal.  We allow ourselves to believe our pain is not justified.  Or somehow we are being overly sensitive.</p>
<p>I am here to remind you, my wonderful friends – what’s normal and what&#8217;s not.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">If you want a functional relationship with a man – stop accepting dysfunction in your life. </span></p>
<p><strong>Not Normal:</strong></p>
<p>Verbal and physical abuse (including mistreatment of our children)</p>
<p>Drinking until they pass out</p>
<p>Lying and covering up alcohol or drug use</p>
<p>Criminal behavior</p>
<p>Irresponsible behavior (over spending, not coming home)</p>
<p>Unemployment</p>
<p><strong>It’s totally acceptable (and necessary) for you to desire a man who is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong></p>
<p>Honest</p>
<p>Trustworthy (follows through with his promises)</p>
<p>Makes healthy lifestyle choices</p>
<p>A good friend and role model for others</p>
<p>Provider and contributor to your family</p>
<p>Shows up and calls when he says he will</p>
<p>Start praying for God to teach you what is best for you, to direct your path and help you carry the load. You are not powerless, you are powerful!  You can have normal!  Did you find this helpful? Please leave a comment and share&#8230; we <span style="color: #ff0000;">LOVE</span> hearing from you!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3877" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am going through the temptation to be codependent today, and this was a great reminder. </p>
<p>A little background&#8230;.my alcoholic husband has been sober for over seven years now, and it has been a great blessing. However, he has used substances off and on and currently smokes marijuana. He has &#8220;dry drunk&#8221; or &#8220;isms&#8221; behavior; meaning that he is controlling, dysfunctional, and blames everyone for his self-created problems. I have stuck by him for ten years, through unemployment, jail, active drinking, cheating, lying, abusive anger, etc. About two years ago, we broke up for a short time because I insisted he go to rehab for a nasty substance addiction that almost killed him. He chose to ask for a divorce, rather than go to rehab. A couple of months went by. He finally relented, went to rehab, and we went to counseling. We put our lives back together, and were really happy. I know it rarely happens with these guys, but we had a somewhat peaceful life for the last two years. I thought that sticking by him had finally paid off.</p>
<p>Two months ago, out of the blue, he asked me for a divorce. He is also Bipolar and somewhat Narcissistic, so this is a “card” he often plays to get his way. However, this time, he was serious and truly wanted a divorce. Due to his employment/driver’s license/financial issues, I had been the major breadwinner. The apartment is in my name, only, and my car belongs solely to me. I had to separate our finances long ago, so everything I have is solely mine. I have a good job, with retirement benefits. Along with the request for a divorce (that was August), he also said that he would be living with me until December, and using my car, as he needed to get on his feet. Of course, this is ridiculous to most people, &#8220;Wait&#8230;.he dumped you but wants you to pay his expenses and use your car?&#8221; I know&#8230;I know. I would have thrown him out, but he promised to make my life hell, drag out the divorce and take everything I own. I had to play nice until it was final.</p>
<p>He and I have been divorced for one week&#8230;as of today. He is still living in my apartment. Also, although he does not have a driver’s license (DUI&#8217;s never resolved), I had allowed him to use my car during the ten years we were married (Codependent, much!) So now, his entitlement tells him that he should still be able to use my car so that he can go to work. He says that if I don&#8217;t allow him to use my car, he won&#8217;t be able to earn the money he needs to move out. When told, &#8220;No&#8221; he gets really nasty. He told me in an email this morning, because I took my own car to work, that he&#8217;s going to move out quickly to avoid my &#8220;power trips.&#8221; (“Power Trip” meaning, I wouldn&#8217;t let him take my car today.) Of course, this would solve the whole problem, but of course, he won&#8217;t do it. The thing about alcoholics/substance abusers is that they use manipulation and threats, but they never follow through. </p>
<p>I’m ready to do what I need to do. Help me, My Sisters!!! Let me hear what you think&#8230;.</p>

<p>My sweet friend.  You know what you need to do.  You have always known.  I can tell because you know enough about codependency to identify the behaviors,  you just need to believe that you are lovable and worthy of so much more.  He has a rock bottom and so do you &#8211; there will be a time when you say enough is enough. And until then, the suffering will continue.  But I am not telling you anything you don&#8217;t already know.  </p>

Thankfully I see behaviour in the acceptable category but can check &#8220;yes&#8221; for all in the unacceptable category. My husband has been living elsewhere since mid Sept has been doing well which is great, has come to some family get-to-gethers (Can Thanksgiving, my birthday) and today came over and helped me with things at the house. We see each other at church but our boys aren&#8217;t interested in interacting with him and I&#8217;m staying out ofbthe way to allow God to do what He wants to do in all of us&#8230;my coubsellor coined it &#8220;curious&#8221; not &#8220;concerned&#8221;.<br />
Today however while driving him back casually I found out that he&#8217;d gone to look at a house with a female real estate agent a few years ago. Part of my frustration has been not being on the same page, lack of transparency  and in my kind of relationship, if a spouse books an appointment to look at a house we&#8217;d both admired  you&#8217;d share it and invite the other to come. My reaction was surpise and mistrust and he hated the feeling that he&#8217;d done something wrong yet again. This may be my baggage from his drinking  (mistrust) but sometimes you feel like you did something wrong because you did.  I&#8217;m open to both but this helped to clearly illustrate our need for marriage counselling  (haven&#8217;t really had any) and underscored why we can rush back to reuniting as this feeling pf screwing up makes him angery and drives him to drink..so not really your topic but sort of related to your title,  moving forward i have to figure out what&#8217;s ok and not ok&#8230;..</p>

First, you can comment about ANYTHING going on in your life.  We love to hear it all!<br />
Second, you are so correct!  Our bad codependent habits can set a really unhealthy negative tone in the relationship.  They don&#8217;t cause someone to drink because he is a big boy and is the only one who can refuse to put the glass up to his mouth.  But, we certainly have responsibility.   </p>
<p>Marriage counseling is good but you really need to continue to do your own work individually. You are sick, just like he is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so proud of you for going to a therapist, well done!!  What else are you doing for your recovery program?  What books are you reading, are you going to Alanon or Celebrate Recovery?  Have you purchased the Love Over Addiction Program?</p>
<p>We love you and are here for you every step of the way!  You are not alone. Sending you a big hug!!<br />

Itbwas a good thing today because it illustrated our need for healing&#8230;he doesn&#8217;t like being away and not with us (renting a room with strangers isn&#8217;t fun) and I haven&#8217;t outlined any terms for coming back ..originally he was going to do a 12 mos Teen Challenge program) but I&#8217;ve said to the boys that we&#8217;re aiming for awesome because that&#8217;s the kind of God we serve and God is going to be doing things in each of us as we go..in different ways and different timing. ..My healing is in layers too. In addition to ongoing Christian counselling I&#8217;ve &#8220;graduated&#8221; from a 1 year CR program and still stay in &#8220;accountability &#8221; and friendship with my 2 partners but we&#8217;ve decided to redo step 4 and our inventories and I intend to focus more on the alcoholism and codependency as before it was mostly around an affair. I&#8217;ve done renewal prayer, deliverance and a Bondage Breaker small group which i want to spend some more time on. I haven&#8217;t got the Love over Addiction program yet&#8230;i will try to get that soon.<br />
While things are a lot better with just me and the boys I&#8217;m not thriving health wise nor at work and i owe it to God to me and to my boys to get more disciplined&#8230;I&#8217;m pretty close to turning that corner.<br />
Thanks again for this forum! !</p>

He brought wine into the hospital and acted like it was a hotel &#8212; complaining that they&#8217;re weren&#8217;t enough towels and pillows.  Just what I needed &#8212; to care for a &#8220;child&#8221; and a new baby.  When we went home, he got so drunk and was throwing food and then later wanted to carry the baby up the stairs.  It was awful and I now that I&#8217;m typing this, it&#8217;s clear that I haven&#8217;t forgiven him for this.  He never says that he&#8217;s sorry.  That was 21 months ago.  It is hard to love a man that you can&#8217;t trust.</p>

Your comment this afternoon inspired this post:).  Sometimes I read a comment and think &#8211; that&#8217;s soo good. I have to write about that!</p>
<p>Ahhh&#8230;forgiveness.  Super hard when we are still drowning in this disease.  It&#8217;s especially hard to forgive when someone has hurt our children.  But forgiveness is necessary for healing.  Why?  Because we are harming ourselves when we hold in all that resentment and anger.  Look up Matthew 18: 21-22 (if you have a bible), if not &#8211; google it.  We are no greater or less than our loved ones.  </p>
<p>Pray for your heart to be transformed but remember sweet friend, forgiving is necessary and so are boundaries.  </p>
<p>WIth love, love, love and gratitude for your comment!  Look at how many women you blessed by opening up?!<br />

Codependency need not be for life, as the Lord is the only one we should be totally dependent on.  Yes, we all are in need of certain things in life, but to what extent does that need become a mastery in the person??<br />
 I believe, that the Lord wants us to live in healthy interdependent relationships where 2 people are growing on their own, and they move through life depending on the Lord, not suffocating each other by dragging the other down, or depending on something unhealthy as a substance.</p>

Codependents have been around since the beginning of time.  Ask yourself this&#8230;have you done one or more of the following things in the last 30 days?<br />
1.  Have your worried yourself sick about other people?<br />
2.  Have your tried to help in ways that didn&#8217;t help?<br />
3.  Have you said yes when you really meant no?<br />
4.  Have your tried a little too hard to make other people see it your way?<br />
5.  Have you bent over backwards to avoid hurting other peoples feelings?<br />
6.  Have your been afraid to trust the direction you feel God is leading you?<br />
7.  Have you believed lies and then felt betrayed?<br />
8.  Have you wanted to get even and punish others?<br />
9.  Have you struggled for your rights while other people said you didn&#8217;t have any?<br />
10.  Have your worn sackcloth because you didn&#8217;t believe you deserved silk? </p>
<p>I know I have&#8230; recovery is necessary to find our happiness, joy and love for ourselves. We must be careful to take daily inventory that we are not reacting to others in a codependent way (and if we do, to auto correct immediately).</p>
<p>Hope this helps:)<br />
Love you!<br />

It&#8217;s so very hard to realize that there is no getting the love back that<br />
you had with who you thought would always be that &#8220;special&#8221; man<br />
in your life.  Now it&#8217;s the ugly rumors about us in a &#8220;small community&#8221;, and how hard it is to ignore.  I&#8217;ll keep praying and Michelle it is so special knowing I have a special friend in you.  I need you more each day.    Many blessings to you.</p>

He was in the car too. I told him it was embarrassing when he was intoxicated. He said just to take him home that I would have more fun. Which he corrected himself but i would be less stressed (not his exact wording). Why does that make me feel so guilty, to set some boundaries? Basketball season starts soon and I want to say if you are intoxicated I don&#8217;t want you to go. Our son plays so it won&#8217;t be as easy as tonight. I&#8217;ve been to a counselor once and she said he shouldn&#8217;t drive (if he&#8217;s been drinking) and by me taking him I&#8217;m enabling him. I&#8217;m going to counseling again. I have a really hard time confronting people. My husband is a really nice guy when he isn&#8217;t drinking, he would give you the shirt off his back. Someone commented on how helpful he is tonight. He does have the Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. If he was always a jerk it would be easier. Not that I&#8217;m wishing for that. I just need to get stronger. At times I think I am and then times like tonight I wonder&#8230;</p>

to others and how he can put me down (how this is my fault and not his). He recently went to the doctor for a prostate checkup and is now cancer free, but<br />
when asked how long it has been since he had sex, he couldn&#8217;t remember and<br />
the doctor asked him &#8220;why&#8221;?, and only said &#8220;I need to work on the house, and I<br />
still drink &#8220;a little&#8221;.  AND&#8230; the excuses go on, plus the doctor told him &#8220;If you are not having sex, you need to find a new partner!&#8221;  I so wanted to say &#8220;Go ahead&#8221;.  I see<br />
many female alcoholics who would love to have him when they come into the bar<br />
we own.  I used to think &#8220;will we ever work all of this out?&#8221; but not as long as he<br />
thinks that he only &#8220;drinks a little&#8221;.  He is on meds for a sinus infection and still<br />
drinking (like the meds will work with alcohol).   The rumors going around about<br />
us are sometimes tough to take but he says things behind the bar to customers<br />
and it is no wonder the &#8220;rumors start&#8221;.  The lastest is that we are closing Dec. 31st.<br />
He just can&#8217;t be quiet about our life and the work we need to do.  He puts on a good<br />
show for &#8220;some of the customers&#8221; though.  The real friends understand what I am<br />
going through, and I cherish them.  Hang in there Jo.  He tells me he loves me, but how can someone feel that way and emotionally hurt me otherwise?<br />
My prayers are with you and for everyone of us to be stronger. Keep praying!</p>

Alcoholics and addicts are master manipulators and they often attract other alcoholics.  Most healthy people with good boundaries discover they have a drinking problem and stay away.<br />
Joan, my question to you is: do you love him?<br />

I know I need to set boundaries and work harder at it.  I took 2 days off from the resort, and it was wonderful having &#8220;my time&#8221; for me.  I spent time with my dad.  His pain is increasing and he tries so hard to be strong.  He doesn&#8217;t want to be a burden anymore.  His birthday is in 2 weeks, but I won&#8217;t deny he needs to join family in heaven and celebrate with them.  It&#8217;s so hard to see him failing.  For myself, at least I have a place to live away from my husband for some sanity.<br />
I have been good in keeping my mouth shut, but he goaded me on Monday and sometimes it&#8217;s so hard to be quiet.  Many thanks for your prayers for my dad, and I will continue to try to keep those boundaries in place, and&#8230; PRAY!!</p>

First, let me congratulate you for having the courage to get a restraining order. </p>
<p>How did the therapy go today?  Continue to encourage your daughter to attend therapy and remember that if the first counselor doesn&#8217;t fit, try another.  </p>
<p>Do not accept calls or texts (block them on your phone) from him.  I would seek legal advice from a lawyer what your choices are concerning your daughter.  Ask how she feels about her father and work with her counselor.  Remember:  JUST LISTEN to your daughters feelings.  DO NOT impose your pain on her.  Be there for her every step of the way and just let her get it out.  No bad mouthing him.  No matter how she feels, it&#8217;s ok.  Just listen and empathize.  </p>
<p>You can do it Jennifer.  We will be praying for you too.  Please let us know how the appointment went today.  </p>
<p>xoxo<br />

 My husband got out of rehab yesterday evening after another 21 day stint&#8230; And he&#8217;s angrier than ever&#8230; And has only my daughter to cling to. And is totally pointing fingers at everyone around him&#8230; I can see my girl even physically be depressed when she came back from his graduation&#8230;. And am going to work very hard at just listening to her&#8230; And not bad mouthing him in any way&#8230;. Which is honestly very hard&#8230; but I know absolutely crucial to not push her away!!! Which besides my sanity/and safety and hers is most important to me!! Thank you.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3896" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi, I stumbled upon your blog a couple of weeks ago and I have not been able to stop thinking about the things I have read on your blog. Thank you for the work you are doing. I have been married to my husband for 14 years, his drinking has been a part of our relationship the entire time. He is a high functioning alcoholic, and very good at hiding his consumption. Everything fell a part 8 years ago when our son was stillborn at full term. My husbands drinking escalated, and ended up needing to be addressed. In a way you could say I lightened the bottom of his fall, and he went to 30 day inpatient rehab and then entered a 5 year monitoring program. He lasted 6 months sober, then he figured out how to cheat the system and entered into his current drinking cycle, long periods of sobriety and then secretive binge drinking. I have seen what long periods of sobriety look like for us as a couple and as a family, it is what I want.  Recently, I have discovered that my husband&#8217;s usage has increased and he is starting to get sloppy with his hiding.  I know what this means for us, if he doesn&#8217;t chose to do something about the drinking problem he says he has under control. After this last episode of discovery, I feel like I am finally awake.  I realize that things will not get better for us.  I can not control his recovery, only mine.  I want a loving, TRUSTING relationship, with someone who is embracing who they are instead of denying the truth of themselves.  I am sad for both of us.  My husband is a good and loving man, but he is sick and he is afraid to be sober. I am afraid that I may spend my whole life unhappy, waiting for the man I know he can be.  Is that me trying to change him? I love him, but I deserve something deeper, truer, more intimate. Am I just being selfish? I know I can continue to live like this and it would probably be best for everyone, especially my children.  My husband drinks at night after we all go to bed, I don&#8217;t think they are affected by his drinking only by the disconnect between their parents. I feel like I am going crazy, with indecision and &#8216;what if&#8217;s&#8217;.  I would love some guidance and advice if you have any to give.</p>

Oh my goodness, you sound so much like me.  I feel like I could have written those words six years ago.  A few things to remember:<br />
1.  This is a progressive disease.  The older he gets the more he will need to consume.<br />
2.  They are all good men who are very, very sick.<br />
3.  You are NOT selfish at all.  Wanting a man who is reliable, honest, and loving is totally reasonable (and attainable).<br />
So here&#8217;s the truth, rather than worrying if you can stay with him or not.  Forgive yourself for choosing to stay today &#8211; you reserve the right to change your mind tomorrow.  Ask yourself:  where am I being codependent?  What do I need to change?  Focus on YOU and your recovery.</p>
<p>I want to hear from you again so please keep me updated.  We are here for you!<br />

You are right&#8230;complaining is a waste of time and brings you no closer to the results you are looking for.</p>
<p>The next time you want to nag him &#8211; make a better choice and remove yourself from the situation.  You are in charge of your feelings.  Go do something that would bring you joy.  Melody, you are a sweet, loving woman who has been around dysfunctional, sick men most of her life.  You can start to take back your power today by walking away and starting to do things for yourself.  </p>

<p> Its now my Second Alnon meeting and started the love over addiction.  All this information has turn a light on the deception of the dysfunction we have been living in all these years.   I realize I have work to do but as I learn and practice Alnon/ love over addiction its first things first and I need to keep it simple.  My husband was totally telling me I was weak cause I was going to the meeting.  And then he starts drinking and wants a discussion or debate before I go.  I press my way to sanity every time<br />
  Something inside me believes that o can&#8217;t have a normal life cause  I&#8217;m sick.  Tolerating this no work, irresponsible behavior.  I&#8217;m the answer to my question an enabler.  Lacking boundaries, low self esteem and so much more.  My recovery is so crucial because I feel like I&#8217;m dying sometimes and I just want to run away to relieve the pain, but the tools of Alnon and love over addiction are going to help me overcome and face my fears learn this lesson and build character so I don&#8217;t have to repeat this life lesson again.</p>
<p> Love Angela cheese</p>

<p>Look at you!!  How amazing that you are taking back control of your healing and recovery!  Remember the more you get help the more this disease tries to hold you back.  But don&#8217;t stop attending the meetings and listening to the Love Over Addiction Program.  The more you listen, the better and faster the results.  Keep working and striving.  You can do it!!  Your dream life is right around the corner.  Do your work and watch how much your life will transform.  We are so, so proud of you!<br />

<p>I just don&#8217;t how much I can take of his anger.  I know that its the disease but its so overwhelming at times one little thing sets him off and all of sudden I&#8217;m the reason for the whole argument.  Its so painful&#8230; it hurts because a part of me says run and the other part that&#8217;s dysfunctional says stay.  Have the tools but I have been sinking so deep for so long its like someone trying to rescue me from drowning and I&#8217;m kicking trynna swim and I&#8217;m steady going under.  Ughhh  God please deliver me from this evil!!! </p>

I have been married to an alcoholic who also has an anger problem for 11 years.  He has a good job, pays the bills and seldom even seems drunk in the conventional sense but he drinks form the time he gets up until the time he goes to bed, nearly every day.  He is unable to have conversations that don&#8217;t apply to him, He gets angry when he is expected to do anything for anyone else, is completely emotionally unavailable and is becoming verbally abusive.  He gets unreasonably angry over every day things and is very negative, calling people names and blaming everybody else for his problems.  I don&#8217;t like him and he is starting to scare me.  a few months ago when I tried to verbalize how I was feeling he told me that the next person that tries to leave him will get a bullet&#8230;I started to plan my exit that day.  He has had two previous wives who have left him due to anger and alcohol problems (he tells people they were cheating on him).  I have everything in place to leave but am stuck with regard to actually doing it.  I feel guilty and underhanded as I have made plans behind his back and leaving without an adult conversation feels really bad.  Any advice on getting past the guilt?</p>

He tells them terrible lies about me, then believes them when they say what a horrible person I must be, and he should stear clear of me as I am for him! How weird is that!! Problem is, how can I defend myself &#8211; it is his word against mine, and he comes across as such a lovely, caring person in the community, willing to do anything for anyone. Urrggg!!!<br />
All I can say to you, Jo, is &#8211; why should you be expected, or indeed expect it of yourself, to keep his drinking a secret? I was accused of telling people that my boyfriend is an alcoholic. My response was, if you are so ashamed of your drinking and don&#8217;t want people to know, then why do you do it?<br />
You, Jo, or any of you, should not be expected to tell lies and keep secrets to cover up his filthy habit. Better that everyone knows, then maybe it will have some effect on him when he knows his secret is out and everyone knows what a loser he is. Who knows? But those are my thoughts.   Lorna (LaLa)</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1843" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello,<br />
I am married to my husband for almost 30 years and he does not care if I divorce him. He was arrested for DUI and the only reason, he goes to AA- is that, his lawyer had recommended him to do so. Otherwise, he is still drinking, after he went to his Rehab &amp; AA for 3-months. He does NOT care of anyone except himself &amp; is verbally abusive. I have given him another 4- months to straighten out and I will file for a divorce. Sell the house and move out. This is draining my energy and we have 2- boys. He is so jealous of our eldest son and he had to drink again, due to his jealousy. Had threaten to move out to another woman&#8217;s house &#8211; told him, go ahead and do not come back. He did this before several times in our course of marriage. So, I am so fed up with him. I do NOT like to be old with him and the nasty name callings- he does to me. We always fight everyday. Now, it is every weekends. I have tolerated all his short comings but NOT with his drinking and constant name callings. I&#8217;ve better off without him. The boys are also fed up with him too.<br />
He likes me to dye his hair so that he will look younger for the ladies. He likes to flirt in front of me &amp; it is disgusting. He had NO respect for me. He likes to hurt me by demonstrating this kind of behavior.<br />
He kept on saying he is so sorry and he does it again. He had NO word of Ownership. How can you trust a man that steal from you? He was looking for money and he took the money in my drawer- without telling me.<br />
When confronted, he lied. I cannot live with a man that I cannot trust anymore.<br />
He is drunk every weekend and likes to instigate a fight all the time.<br />
*This is his last chance to redeem himself, to be sober and change for the better. But there&#8217;s a BIG &#8220;IF,&#8221;<br />
he is willing to change. I doubt it. He had 4- months and he knows that. My patience is running out and I will have to file a divorce after 4- months.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1893" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I need some feedback on &#8220;Dry Drunk/addict.&#8221; My husband quit drinking &amp; pot smoking &amp; some Misc. drugs 20 years ago. Definitely an addict. Life seemed like it got better for a while. We were getting marriage counseling from our church &amp; it was working. Counselor said at one point we did not need her any more that we knew what to do. I still go back to her a couple times a year for a tune up. Our 2 kids are grown &amp; gone. We have been married 30 years. However in the last 10 years it has been going bad. He is a real estate broker &amp; the market crash in 2008 hit us hard. He&#8217;s still doing real estate but not much.  He has been on a downward spiral ever since. He is not using drugs or alcohol, but acts like it. He sleeps 10 hours a day, watches TV 8 hours a day. The rest is eating,showering etc. &amp; doing a little bit of &#8220;work&#8221;. He&#8217;s now making barely $1300.00 per month from property management. I make that part time at my job. He has grown lethargic. Yet I have had people ask me if he&#8217;s bi-polar. Not that any of that would matter, he won&#8217;t listen to me any way. When I suggested that other Realtors in the area were doing &#8220;listings&#8221; &amp; they said that&#8217;s what you have to do in this market his response was &#8220;oh that&#8217;s too much work&#8221;. So I&#8217;ve been back to my counselor. I have been re reading the &#8220;boundaries books &amp; Beyond Boundaries&#8221;, Townsend &amp; Cloud. I have been putting these into practice now for a while &amp; see how my counselor has been having me do them. I think it&#8217;s putting pressure on my husband, he&#8217;s been getting worse. My counselor says he is a &#8220;dry drunk&#8221; &amp; getting worse. I believe it&#8217;s because even though he quit using drugs &amp; alcohol, he&#8217;s never gone through an &#8220;AA&#8221; or &#8221; Celebrate Recovery&#8221; program to work all the steps. I did for myself &amp; I worked all the steps &amp; could say I&#8217;ve come clean &amp; free. &amp; with &#8220;Boundaries&#8221; I have a new lease on life. I guess I have a hard time understanding &#8220;dry drunk&#8221; for 20 years. But I do see that his behaviors &amp; habits are still there. In our 30 years of marriage we had three bankruptcies, last one just this year. I am afraid that he is facing 60 years old this year &amp; I am 55. I don&#8217;t have any hope for this.The verbal mental &amp; emotional abuse goes on, my counselor says &#8220;just leave the house when he does this&#8221; but I am at the point I am not home very much any more. He has his real estate office in our 2 bedroom apt. 1 is his office, right next to living room. So I either come home to an office (if he is doing work) or a movie theater when he is watching TV. I don&#8217;t have a home to go to, so I stay out at friends houses or sit in my car somewhere &amp; read&#8221;Boundaries&#8221; Though I know with God all things are possible. I am giving up this year. I have had more than enough, &amp; waited &amp; tried. Even our daughter with our grandkids does not want to be around him any more. &amp; all this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

This is the first I have seen of your site and can&#8217;t stop crying that maybe someone can and will understand what Im going through.  I use to be so strong and independent women. Now a mom of twin girls (3 1/2 yrs old),  I am very angry, exhausted, sad and fed up. My husband sits on the couch every day and drinks 3 bottles of wine or more while I do EVERYTHING.  I feel like I am loosing my mind. </p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t he see (or care) how hard I am working to keep this household together?  He complains the house is a pig stye, and ridiculed me for what a mess it is. I can&#8217;t keep up with all the chores, kids, laundry, house, bills on my own. I&#8217;m questioning myself, why can&#8217;t I keep up, other women do it, but they have some help right, a supportive husband that does not spend the majority of everyday at the bar or on the couch drinking, right? Or am I just nuts?</p>
<p>Is it the alcohol that keeps them from having any ambition to get off the couch, except when he needs to get up and get another glass of wine? I just watch cause if I say anything to him, it is an argument.  My girls are starting to overhear the arguing and it scares them.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1914" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My alcoholic partner left me today. He has done this many times before and it always happens after a drinking session but this time it has a air of permanence. Accusations fly in every direction and bucket loads of irrational behaviour are thrown in my direction. We have been together for 4 years and I am by my very nature one of life&#8217;s rescuers so I guess once I realised he was an alcoholic I was not deterred by it because I thought that with love, care and support, I could help him on the road to recovery. The reality though is that I cannot cure him and the pain of loving someone so deeply and watching them kill themselves is crippling. I listened to an interview online by the husband of a recovering alcoholic the other day and he said &#8216;I loved and still love my alcoholic wife but I needed to love her because if I did not I would have run&#8217;. He went on to say that at the end of every single working day he came home and checked two things. The first were the pots in the kitchen sink because if they were still there from breakfast he knew she would be drunk in bed. The second was to check the bottom of the stairs because every day he fully expected his wife to has be dead at the bottom of them with a broken neck following a drinking session. When he was at work he would will her to just trip up and fall down the stairs to end the misery of the life he had to endure but she never tripped up. Still he could not leave her. He stuck with her for years until one day she went to AA of her own accord. I learnt a number of things listening to his story. It is not wrong to love and alcoholic and it is okay to stay if you wish to. I have been berated many times by people I know for staying with my partner but I understand why I do or did. It is also okay to have feelings of hurt, betrayal and deep sadness yet still stay. Just like the alcoholic finding it so hard to give up their alcohol, some of us find it hard to give up the alcoholic. I understand the importance of getting my life on track, going to the gym, seeing friends and family and moving on but it is so hard sometimes. I believe strongly that I matter and that I can get through this and I believe I will be happy one day but the pain and sadness right now is hard. I often question who has the bigger problem, me or him? Me for being unable to walk away (despite the fact that he just has) or him for his drinking. Thank you for listening.</p>

My husband makes me question everything makes me think that I am overreacting . I recently petition for divorce because he has his fourth pending DUI . He was passed out at a light and is trying to convince everyone it was from exhaustion . The police officer asked him to take a breathalyzer and he refused and did not pass roadside . Still I question if he is an alcoholic , I don&#8217;t understand why my logic is so clouded by all my emotions . What are the signs that he is an alcoholic ?  He does not as far as I know drink every single day . I don&#8217;t allow alcohol in the house since he got his third DUI and was in jail . He has manipulated me and convinced me so many things for so long I question everything . What are some definite signs that I can know that my husband is for sure an alcoholic . He has gone out until one or three in the morning sometimes never even come home, he has lied, he never came home one night and it did not take my son to school . All the while he says it is my fault for the divorce that I am the reason that I am the bad guy.  Why do I let him get to me ? I tried to preserve our marriage every morning I tried to be the best wife I could be.  I wanted functional in my life and I have been living in so much dysfunction that I don&#8217;t even know what functional is anymore . Please help , I need answers and I&#8217;m not sure where to go.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2106" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My husband is addicted to Marijuana. We met in AA when I was 2 years sober 8 years ago. I&#8217;ve remained sober &amp; active in AA. He relapsed with pot 3 years ago. He was using behind my back for a year before I found out. I find the betrayal most difficult to deal with as well as the chronic lying that goes along with the drug use. I have caught him in many, many lies involving the pot &amp; now I have lost all trust in him. I think to myself that if he can lie to me for a year &amp; then continue to lie right to my face &#8211; what else is he lying about? It&#8217;s heartbreaking &amp; i hate the whole thing. I&#8217;ve watched his progression with my own eyes. He is now in full blown addiction getting high every day, multiple times a day. Getting high while driving,  getting high while working,  getting high all the time. I can&#8217;t stand it. I have much to lose in a divorce &amp; i just want him to stop, but I know he won&#8217;t.  Nobody in either of our families knows about it. I&#8217;m keeping his secret because I know both families will FREAK OUT because we both came back from serious alcohol &amp; drug addictions. I have been sober over 10 years &amp; he&#8217;s been using again for over 3 years now. It just sucks.</p>

I read over the lists of &#8220;how to tell&#8221; and really couldn&#8217;t answer yes to many of the items.  He doesn&#8217;t drink until he passes out.  But he does drink a magnum of wine every weeknight.  He&#8217;ll easily put away two on a Saturday, starting his drinking earlier in the day.  He hides his drinking.  He&#8217;s stopped easily, comments how great it feels to not be drinking then starts up within a few days, seemingly forgetting how great he felt just days earlier.  My 18 year old son called me at 12:30 in the morning on a weekend when I had gone away with some girlfriends.  He had come home to the television blaring and his father passed out in front of it, slurring his words as he got up to go to bed.  My grown son was crying.  I was hundreds of miles away.  I came home from that weekend&#8211;it was Super Bowl Sunday and our Seattle Seahawks were playing.  By the time I got home at 1:00, he had already been to the bar for &#8220;breakfast&#8221; which usually included 2-3 mimosas and was starting in on the wine.  We argued that night because I commented that he had gone through two huge bottles of wine.  He swore at me, dropping the f-bomb, telling me to shut my f-ing mouth and to shut the f*** up.  I walked out.  </p>
<p>His mother and father are both alcoholics.  He&#8217;s told me of multiple experiences, as a boy, when his father would come home drunk, wake him up (he was the youngest of 5 children), and scream and humiliate him.  His parents live less than a mile away but he rarely goes to see them.  His father suffered an almost life threatening stomach bleed because of his drinking.  His mother claims the doctors told her it could happen to anyone.  She continues to give him alcohol.</p>
<p>He got off of work &#8220;early&#8221; this afternoon.  By the time I got home at 5pm, he had finished one of his large bottles of wine, was slurring his words and falling asleep in his easy chair.  </p>
<p>And I still want to believe he&#8217;s not really an alcoholic.</p>
<p>But I also can&#8217;t see myself living like this any longer.  </p>
<p>Give up the bottle or give up the marriage.  What will he choose?</p>

I question daily if he really is an alcoholic, I have even had a marriage counselor tell me that he is one.  I still wonder if he is and I still want to be in denial because I love this man . My husband is a binge alcoholic I do not allow alcohol in the house so he goes out after his masters classes or after bowling league or golf league until one or two in the morning and passes out on the couch or sometimes in the garage half in and half out of the car . He has had three DUIs, two prior to marriage which he never told me about and a fourth one pending . This last time is when I got the clue that my husband had a problem and even then I wanted to believe that it wasn&#8217;t true. I asked him do marriage counseling and to stop drinking and he did not want to continue counseling but did continue drinking . I was so hopeful that he would want to work on our marriage and save our life together but it was not what he wanted and even when I said I wanted a divorce and ended up having to serve him papers I  thought he would come back . He then told me the drinking is one of the finer things in life and I about laughed because in my book a wife and three children are one of the finer things in life. I am still in love with my husband but we are now in the middle of a divorce.  I still wonder if he is one, if I got it wrong, if I was mistaken.  What helps me is to make a list of all of his actions through our marriage that did not feel functional or right . I have to read that list daily, I turned a blind eye to a lot of what he did because I wanted my marriage to work I wanted my dream of living with this man to work.  However, when my children began getting emotionally hurt that&#8217;s when I decided that I could best help everyone by leaving . It has been the most difficult decision of my life , I constantly read this blog, I see a therapist , I read self-help books and books on functional alcoholism, and I keep moving forward and in my free time I try to do something for me.  I know that leaving is what I am supposed to do for the greater good of everyone involved and because love is not enough , at least in my situation it is not . I replied to your post because everything you said made me see the similarity in our curiosity and constant wonder if he is an alcoholic . I also wanted to reply to you because it feels good to have someone acknowledge feelings and acknowledge that they to feel the same or at least something similar . I have come to the conclusion that I was emotionally abused and that I feel as though I  cannot count on my feelings and my thoughts because according to him they were wrong . So now I still question out of habit the facts as I see them, the fact that other people have seen and if I have made the right choice . I am getting better about the latter three because I believe that my children deserve functionality and I feel good about myself but it is hard because I never loved anyone as much as I loved my husband.</p>
<p> My heart goes out to you and I hope that it gets easier and more clear . If you&#8217;re anything like me the constant questioning inside your mind is exhausting and for me unhealthy because ultimately I&#8217;m questioning myself and my feelings or moral values .</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2211" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi,  I&#8217;m glad to have come across your website.  I struggle to find balance or what is right or wrong.  My partner of 14 years is an alcoholic.  He lies about drinking and have been caught hiding alcohol around the house or in his car.  He can go without drinking but usually only when I am monitoring him.  He is not abusive or violent and works hard and earn decent income and basically does well at work.  He does not drink til he passes out or anything like that but unless I am around to monitor him, he&#8217;ll drink too much.  His whole family has alcohol addiction issues, like his dad, he&#8217;s generally a quiet drinker. His mum has major depression due to his dad being an alcoholic and I guess feeling disappointed that she&#8217;s not with a man she thinks she should be with.  I am afraid I will turn out like her and he will turn out like his dad (drinking everyday, lose his job) I don&#8217;t know if I should except that I am with an alcoholic and find a way to deal with it and not become resentful or if I should leave.  Every time I think of leaving, I also think about so many good things we have so I don&#8217;t leave.  I am not financially dependant on him so I am not staying for security but because, drinking aside, we&#8217;re really happy and we get on really well hence the 14yrs of being together.  When he drinks he does become annoying even though not abusive, he&#8217;s obviously not the same person when he&#8217;s not drinking and that annoys me as I feel like I live with 2 people.   My job is stressful and to not be able to come home and talk to him because he&#8217;s too drunk to understand anything, over time, is getting really annoying.  Because he tells lies and it seems to be getting worse as we get older, there&#8217;s been a lot of fighting over this which will result with me screaming at him.  I don&#8217;t like being like this but my patience is just not really there.  At times, I am able to calm myself down and just not say anything but I am getting more and more upset by this.  I&#8217;m sorry for such a lengthy details.  I guess I really don&#8217;t know what the right thin to do but I believe that I don&#8217;t want to leave, I just don&#8217;t know how I should deal with this.  All online materials regarding alcoholism usually involved partner being abusive, so I feel like I haven&#8217;t been able to get any advice about my situation.  I have told him to see a counsellor and he has agreed to do that.  The counsellor requested to speak with me after speaking to my partner, but even he (the counsellor) told me he drinks every night and he doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any wrong with that though he agrees and my partner hiding drinks is not a healthy habit.</p>

That in itself is a relief, I wonder sometimes if I am the one who is off my rocker!  My husband, an alcoholic for years, also had his adulterous affair exposed six years ago.  The Lord said not to divorce him at that time (we have children).  Our children were very young at the time and the Lord gave me all the reasons why He hates divorce.  I submitted and did not divorce my husband.  The drinking didn&#8217;t stop, Two years ago, another affair to some degree was exposed again.  This time the Lord said to move out with my children immediately and we did.  We were separated for a year and a half and then the Lord said it was time to move back to our home.  I wrestled with the Lord over it but once again went in obedience but heels digging in let me tell you as I knew the drinking had not stopped.  In the process of time and all the lies, lost hopes and dreams, I became angry and just in the last few months the Lord has shown me I became bitter and as a result was not prospering in my place of employment like I should have been (sales).  The drinking continues.  My children do not have the example of a godly father.  When he is sober, he prays at the table or gets in the Word of God for a short time in the morning.  His own business takes him into bars and places where alcohol is sold so the daily downward spiral begins.  I did not approve of this business to start with for all the reasons it has brought death and destruction to our marriage and family but he&#8217;s going to do what he wants to do.<br />
We go to a spirit filled bible believing charismatic church with him.  He doesn&#8217;t walk the talk.  Still, the Lord has not released me from this marriage.  Lately, it has been Exodus 14:14, &#8220;The Lord will fight for you and you shall hold your peace.&#8221;  I struggle with the belief this situation will change, I struggle with having to deal with this everyday, I struggle with &#8220;Why Lord do you let this continue?.&#8221;  There are days I wish he&#8217;d drive off a cliff and release us all from the pain and suffering and frustration.  I hate the lying to cover up where he has been.  How does God require a woman to remain married to a man she can&#8217;t trust???  I can&#8217;t make sense of it all-it&#8217;s insanity.</p>

He is a functioning alcoholic. Never mean or verbally abusive just loves to drink then slip off to bed. I don&#8217;t want our young sons growing up seeing beer cans overflowing the garbage. I&#8217;m over the sloppiness. He chews, so chew all over his side of bed, or pees in shower in middle of night! It&#8217;s embarrassing to say least. I don&#8217;t know where to start, but I&#8217;m tired of playing mommy. I need help. </p>

Can you give me some advice? My husband has been a functioning alcoholic for about 15 of our 23 years of marraige. It never got out of control &#8211; no loss of employment, no DWI, no physical/verbal abuse, no passing out or blackouts. It really never impacted me or our two daughters until 2013. He began drinking all weekend, passing out and falling down. It was frightening for me and our girls. I told him he had to leave, he did for a bit and signed up for an outpatient program. We agreed if that did not work he would enter an inpatient program. He did enter a 28 day program and came out a new person (or back to my old husband). He tried AA but never could connect, although he has continued with weekly therapy and antidepressants. His real therapy became exercising. He maintained sobriety for ten months. He lost 40 pounds. He worked on his depression issues. For the last four months he&#8217;s been in relapse mode. He has dranken three different times and always admits to it. He keeps telling me it will not escalate and it&#8217;s not a pattern he will fall into but I know alcoholism is an insideous disease and it most likely will escalate out of control. I feel a strong need to &#8220;do&#8221; something right now &#8211; throw him out, demand he goes back to rehab &#8211; something. But a big part of me wants to do nothing, sit back and see what unfolds. I told him initially my boundaries were no drinking in our house around me or the girls. Now he has, although the girls are unaware for now. I know no one can tell me what to do but what&#8217;s your advice. I hate to put my kids through another round of him becoming out of control but do I allow my anxiety and fear that it is what will happen determine an action on my part today? </p>
