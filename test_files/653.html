<p><span style="float:left;color:#d4d4c7;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">W</span>hen Typhoon Sanba slammed into Busan in 2012 I had my face pressed to the window of my 10<sup>th</sup> floor apartment in <a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/typhoon-wave.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2270" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/typhoon-wave.jpg?w=300&#038;h=197" alt="typhoon wave" width="300" height="197" /></a>Haeundae Marine City, watching as great roiling waves crashed over the sea wall and raced up the street past my building. When the swells came at a certain angle, water surged through the manhole at the intersection and finally blew the cover off, so that subsequent swells pumped thick columns of water into the air. Gusts of wind rattled our windows hard enough to make me wonder if I should be standing near it. The question was settled a minute later when a pane fell from the 50-somethingth floor of the building across the street and smashed on the sidewalk below.</p>
<p>The storm blew all morning, and when it ended in the early afternoon, I went out for a look. The sun was out and the water had drained from the intersection back to the sea, but the sustained battering had shredded the esplanade that had recently been built along the sea wall. Heavy paving stones lay scattered all over the road and had rendered it impassable to the street-hugging sedans and sports cars common in that part of town.</p>
<p>A group of about thirty men and women had formed a line and were passing large stones off the street hand to hand and stacking them on what remained of the walkway. I wandered around and photographed the carnage, but soon began to feel guilty that my neighbors were doing all the work while I was farting around, so I started picking up stones and adding them to the stacks that were rising by the curb.</p>
<p>I struck up a conversation with a Malaysian fellow named Alex who was doing the same thing. It turns out he lives in the building across from mine and had been watching the storm like me from his window.  We chatted and joked about finally getting some exercise as we lugged dozens of the heavy stones off the road.</p>
<p>About fifteen minutes later a middle-aged Korean man from the cleanup crew approached us with an incredulous look on his face. “Wow! Thank you so much for your help!”</p>
<p><em>Why is he making a big deal about me</em>? I thought. Everybody else was working too, most of them harder than I was. Just as I was beginning to feel a little embarrassed at being singled out for praise when there were thirty other people doing the same thing, he informed me that my assembled ‘neighbors’ were in fact Haeundae district workers who had been dispatched to clear the road. Dressed in plain clothes, they were probably office workers who had been hastily conscripted into an emergency road crew, and they had arrived there so quickly after the storm that both Alex and I assumed they were locals who had spontaneously pitched in to get the traffic moving again.</p>
<p>This revelation made me feel a bit silly for a moment, but I was kind of enjoying it, talking and getting to know my neighbor. We kept working, now joining the line and passing the big stones hand to hand. A man came around and gave us a pair of white work gloves. After the largest stones had been moved they handed out shovels to pick up the smaller ones. After fifteen minutes of that, the job was done, and a woman handed out bottles of water and Choco pies. A man from the work crew asked me for my mailing address. I gave it to him, had a second Choco Pie, and went home feeling good about having gotten out of the house that day.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="float:left;color:#d4d4c7;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">W</span>ith our neighborhood back in order, the storm was already receding from my mind when a piece of mail arrived for me the next day: a thank-you card from the Haeundae District Office.</p>
<p><em>That was nice</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>The day after that, I got a call from Alex. He said a reporter from the Haeundae district newspaper had called him and asked if she could interview us.</p>
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>We met her the next day in Alex’s apartment. As we sat around the table sipping coffee, she asked us why we decided to help clear stones off the road.</p>
<p>I told her the truth: I wrongly assumed that the people clearing the street were my neighbors, and I felt guilty that I wasn’t doing anything to help. What I didn’t tell her was that if I had known they were working for the city, I would have just taken some photos and left. I thought the implication was certainly there, but if she asked me directly I was prepared to spell it out for her: I wouldn&#8217;t have helped.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t ask. Her next question was, “In your hometown, do you help when there are disasters?” and it was instantly clear to me that she had not come all the way over here to interview some schmuck who volunteers because he doesn’t know any better; she was here to write about an exemplary citizen, a paragon of civic virtue. I smiled.</p>
<p>“Not really,” I said. I wanted to give her something but I was drawing a blank. There haven’t been any real disasters in suburban New York since the eradication of the natives in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>“The worst thing that happens is sometimes we get a lot of snow, like a blizzard. Sometimes I’ve helped people dig their cars out of the snow or clear their sidewalk or their driveway so they can get out. Things like that.”</p>
<p>She was nodding and scribbling down the exotic details of shoveling a Westchester driveway, while noting well the implications it carries for &#8211; dare I say freedom? &#8211; in a part of the world that has effectively no public transportation. Much of this detail would find its way into her finished piece, a moving tale of two foreigners who spring to action in times of crisis to keep their hometowns safe, the traffic flowing, and their neighborhoods beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/choco-pie.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2271" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/choco-pie.jpg?w=150&#038;h=84" alt="choco pie" width="150" height="84" /></a>As she was leaving, she thanked us again on behalf of Haeundae District. I told her the Choco Pies had been payment enough, and she laughed.</p>
<p>I wasn’t joking.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="float:left;color:#d4d4c7;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">A</span> few days later Alex called again. “The mayor would like to meet us,” he said.</p>
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>There was no saying no, so a few days later I found myself standing in the office of the Haeundae district mayor, a portly fellow in a dark suit shadowed by an entourage of six other men in dark suits. The reporter who had interviewed us snapped photos as the mayor thanked us, shook our hands, and awarded each of us a plaque that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you very much for voluntarily participating in the Typhoon Sanba recovery efforts in Haeundae Marine City. Your invaluable service has greatly inspired and motivated us to develop Haeundae into a global city. We sincerely appreciate and admire your selfless dedication.</p></blockquote>
<p>After posing for an official photo in front of a backdrop panorama of Haeundae Beach, we sat with the mayor and his entourage around a large table and sipped excellent tea while we recounted our story. As we spoke, a large TV monitor behind us was displaying a slideshow. I wasn’t aware of having been photographed that day, but someone had shot at least two dozen photos, which now played in a loop for the mayor, showing Alex and me in various action poses: picking up stones, passing them off, carrying them away, and laying them in stacks. The staff guys watched the slideshow, nodding and murmuring. When one photo showed me carrying three stones at a time, they murmured a little louder.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much of a story to tell, so the reporter helped  flesh it out with the other nuggets she had gathered, informing the mayor of my former career of digging my countrymen out of deep snow.  I took the opportunity to thank the mayor and his staff for responding so quickly to the storm. It really was fast, and it occurred to me that if it had taken longer, I wouldn’t be having tea and chatting with him right now. The reporter didn’t mention the part about us not knowing that the cleanup crew were city workers, nor did I. There just didn’t seem to be any point in bringing it up and spoiling the party.</p>
<p>Besides, it wasn’t as if they were using me to support a war I didn’t believe in or a product I knew to be harmful. Perhaps there were ulterior political motives – who knows? &#8211; but on the surface they seemed merely to be looking to tell an inspiring if slightly fabricated story that might guilt-trip a few <em>nouveau riche</em> types into being slightly more civic-minded. If that was the worst of it, I could live with that.</p>
<p>When the time came to leave, the mayor again took my hand and said, “Remember me!” Was <em>that</em> the point of all this – to make allies among the foreign community so that we’d go home and tell our wives and friends what a swell fellow he was, or maybe even to encourage us to vote for him myself if I ever got around to applying for the permanent residency visa? Or maybe this is just how you say goodbye to people when you’re the district boss &#8211; a way of reminding the faithful that someday they may be called upon to return the favor.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, I assured the mayor that I would indeed remember him. We said goodbye, and with my plaque tucked under my arm, I found my way outside.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="float:left;color:#d4d4c7;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">I</span>n front of the building, Alex and I joked about being local heroes. &#8220;The next time they call will be to give us a parade and keys to the city,&#8221; I said, but that call of course never came. It also turned out to be the last time I saw Alex.

					<p><span style="float:left;color:#d4d4c7;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">F</span>rom February to June 1787, with all of his necessities packed in a single trunk, Thomas Jefferson traveled &#8220;incognito&#8221; by coach, barge, and sometimes mule across most of France and Northern Italy. Reading the extensive diary he kept of the trip, one encounters many passages like the following.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the boudoir at Chanteloup is an ingenious contrivance to hide the projecting steps of a staircase. Three steps were of necessity to project into the boudoir. They therefore made triangular steps, and, instead of resting on the floor as usual, they are made fast at their broad end to the stair door, swinging out and in with that. When shut, it runs them under the other steps. When open, it brings them out to their proper place.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jefferson1787.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-238" src="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jefferson1787.jpg?w=241&#038;h=300" alt="jefferson1787" width="241" height="300" /></a>I don&#8217;t quote this because it was Jefferson’s most electrifying prose; it&#8217;s not, and to be fair, he never intended to publish it. What <em>is</em> striking about the diary is what it says about Jefferson’s sense of the grand purpose of travel, evidenced by the wealth of detail describing everything from soil types, methods of grape cultivation, the relationship of social conditions to regional crops, and sketches of practical contraptions like the one above. Every page reveals a man bent on devouring as much practical information as he could with an eye toward using it to improve both himself and his country on his eventual return to Virginia. In addition to scouting markets and securing contacts for American agricultural producers (his primary duties as a minister), he brought back with him new varieties of plants, architectural designs and ideas he would later implement, plans for technological devices, and an unparalleled expertise in European wines and viticulture. Not too shabby for an 18<sup>th</sup> century backpacker.</p>
<p>Despite competing with the leisure travel industry for our hearts and minds, the idea of traveling to improve one’s country is still discussed today, though it more often falls under the purview of travel scribes than presidential hopefuls. One of the most vocal and visible contemporary champions of what you might call national-improvement travel is the writer and entrepreneur Rick Steves. In his recent book, <em>Travel as a Political Act</em>, Steves explains the book’s eponymous theme thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we return home, we can put what we’ve learned – our newly acquired broader perspective – to work as citizens of a great nation confronted with unprecedented challenges. And when we do that, we make travel a political act.</p></blockquote>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_239" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/steves-wine.jpg"><img class="wp-image-239 size-medium" src="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/steves-wine.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169" alt="steves wine" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rick Steves, travel writer and man of a sober age.</p></div>
<p>Steves&#8217;s notion that travel can improve one&#8217;s country echoes Jefferson, who wrote to his nephew in 1787 that &#8220;men of a sober age&#8221; could travel to &#8220;gather knowledge, which they may apply usefully for their country<i>.&#8221;</i> There is however an important difference between them: The country Jefferson came home to was agrarian, weak, and relatively undeveloped, so many of his observations found an appreciative audience among a people who felt they had something to learn from Europe. In contrast, Rick Steves has to chip away against the popular conceit that America is exceptional and has little to learn from Europe &#8211; least of all the French, whose label as &#8220;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&#8221; has been un-ironically accepted as the last word on France by the millions of FOX viewers who never quite grasped that learning international studies from Homer Simpson is a bit like learning feminism from Archie Bunker.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_240" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/excited-conversation-300x228.jpg"><img class="wp-image-240 size-full" src="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/excited-conversation-300x228.jpg?w=620" alt="Attractive Expressive Young Mixed Race Female Student Sitting and Talking with Girlfriend Outside on Bench."   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So like, oh my god, I have to tell you about this thing they use in Europe called the metric system&#8230;</p></div>
<p>But like Jefferson, Rick Steves is also a man fired with missionary zeal. In the book, he writes cogently about successful heroin maintenance programs in Switzerland, Sweden’s commonsense approach to underage drinking, the liberal stance toward prostitution in the Netherlands, and several other battle-tested European social policy triumphs. This is well and good until one recalls that Europe is no longer some distant land from which letters take weeks to arrive and none but seamen, diplomats, or the very rich will ever see in person, which points up another difference between Jefferson’s time and our own: the traveler coming back from Europe today isn’t really telling people much that they haven’t already heard.</p>
<p>So if we know about these things, why don’t we implement all these great ideas? Part of the answer lies in yet another important difference between the worlds of Jefferson and Steves: today’s traveler is sharing his European insights with countrymen who are too often hypersensitive to criticism (Love it or leave it!) and who seldom give a hot damn what Europeans do, think, or say. While some of Jefferson’s contemporaries may have replicated the “ingenious contrivance” he observed in the boudoir, today the phrase “solution X has worked in country Y” is rarely the premier feature of a persuasive discourse or a winning debate.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_241" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/sarah-palin-flag-pin.jpg"><img class="wp-image-241 size-medium" src="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/sarah-palin-flag-pin.jpg?w=300&#038;h=203" alt="sarah-palin-flag-pin" width="300" height="203" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Reality star Sarah Palin gazes vigilantly at Russia.</p></div>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to look as far as Europe to overlook an idea. Case in point, socialized medicine in Canada. You can be for it or against it – and I frankly don’t care which &#8211; but one thing that should be very clear by now is that its implementation doesn’t lead down the dreaded “slippery slope” to inevitable and abject totalitarianism, as many Americans strangely imagine despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. For some Americans this is as easy to debunk as literally looking out the window (there goes Sarah Palin’s excuse), yet to point out that Canada has socialized medicine but no dictatorship is to be cheeky or obtuse, not a Jeffersonian visionary.</p>
<p>No doubt mindful of these obnoxious tendencies, Steves is obliged to draw doomed analogies between constructive personal criticism and criticism of one’s equally beloved country:</p>
<blockquote><p>I enjoy bettering myself by observing others. And I appreciate constructive criticism from caring friends. In the same spirit, I enjoy learning about my society by observing other societies and challenging myself to be broad-minded when it comes to international issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d be out of my depth to deal with the question of whether the average person strives to better themselves, but even among people who do, embracing criticism is a leap that many still don’t make. Whatever the reason for that, it leads me back to some of the grand claims that are occasionally made in praise of travel, namely, the idea that the inevitable consequence of travel is growth, openness, or some other species of personal improvement. While it appears to make intuitive sense, the continuing struggles of people like Rick Steves to invite their fellow Americans to engage in transformative introspection or to brook well-intentioned and thoughtful criticism suggests to me that there are in fact prerequisites to this happy side-effect – call it <a href="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ugly-american-thumb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-244" src="https://bosmosis.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ugly-american-thumb.jpg?w=121&#038;h=150" alt="ugly-american-thumb" width="121" height="150" /></a>humility or openness if you like – and that travel does not necessarily teach us those things. Traveling certainly affords the <em>opportunity</em> to learn, but in order to learn something it seems we must first acknowledge that we have something to learn in the first place. Without that mindset, the opportunity is wasted, as evidenced by every self-assured ding-dong, dipshit, and dunderhead who strapped on a backpack and came back with his ignorance intact.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that travel has not cracked open a stubborn nut here and there and managed to ram home an uninvited truth; that happens, though it strikes me as less common. It’s also not hard to find examples of travel gurus (Steves is one) advising us to open our minds <em>prior to traveling</em> in order to get something out of the experience, a tacit acknowledgment that we become travelers by becoming open, but that we can’t count on it happening the other way around.</p>
<p>If our goal is to better our country, is there still a point to purposeful travel, or is bettering ourselves the best we can do? And if openness is the main requirement to do that, does travel have any role in that at all?</p>
<p>The big question seems to be: how do you learn openness?  I don’t really know, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that if you’re headed into a boudoir in Chanteloup, you want to be ready for anything.</p>

					<p>by<a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.wordpress.com/author/regnalo/"> O. Langer</a></p>
<p><span style="float:left;color:#cc4014;font-size:54px;line-height:30px;padding-top:3px;padding-right:3px;font-family:Times, serif, Georgia;">T</span>he ferry to Cebu is late.</p>
<p>Every seat in the large waiting room is taken. Those not sat are stood either against the back wall or in the aisles. There’s a white noise of chatter. Behind microphones, by the doorway the tourists will pass through to embark, are acoustic guitars, a mandolin, a tambourine and a drum. In front is a donation box. Few will put in. The hum of talk won’t abate when the performance starts.</p>
<p>I first get a glimpse of the blind band in amongst the throng, trudging through it, each member with an arm locked in a helper’s for guidance. All are dressed in the ferry company uniform of yellow polo and red shorts, and wearing sunglasses. Though one is a young man, the songs he’ll sing this evening are hits from long before he was born. <em>Massachusetts</em>, by the Bee Gees, is one.</p>
<p><em>Massachusetts</em> was conceived in 1967 during the Summer of Love, as an antithesis to flower power anthems <em>Let&#8217;s Go to San Francisco</em> and <em>San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)</em>, in that the protagonist had been to San Francisco to join the hippies but was now homesick. An idea of the lights having gone out in Massachusetts (the refrain) was to suggest that everyone had gone to San Francisco. It’s a strikingly tender, fragile and pensive lament.</p>
<blockquote><p>And the lights all went out in Massachusetts<br />
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to Bohol, and as the young man sings, I notice a coincidence. Read back the lyric above, as applied to the musicians having lost their sight.</p>
<p>You see? Bohol is their Massachusetts.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful moment. Suddenly, the song is elevated: it’s now all the more heartbreaking. Here they are, blind in paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p>Rewind four years, and I’m in the interview for the job in PR I’ll quit to go to Korea, with the Director of Corporate Affairs. He asks me: “What is your biggest weakness?”</p>
<p>My first thought is how absurd it is to have to state why I shouldn&#8217;t get the job. I could name a thousand reasons I’m not the perfect candidate. Here’s one: I resent having to work. I can’t say that. I can’t declare <em>Excel</em>’s all Greek to me. He doesn’t want full disclosure. No, with this flaw, I’ll have illustrated I’m self-aware and demonstrated deference – important in the workplace. It’s a game. If I’m clever, it won’t even really be a failing.</p>
<p>I think hard. What might he deem an asset?</p>
<p>He sees I’m drawing a blank, and tries to help: “For me, it’s that I struggle to see any option as 100% the way to go. I’m wary with all decisions.”</p>
<p>Clever. He could have said he’s indecisive, but instead he sold it as a leadership quality: tyranny is the removal of nuance – and he’s no tyrant.</p>
<p>He decides to move on. But it&#8217;s at that moment I finally answer: “I’m cynical.”</p>
<p>Am I? Even if not, feigning so was a cynical move.</p>
<p>He smiles, and says: “It’s not a weakness.” He’s impressed. I’ll fit in well.</p>
<p>I don’t. Eventually – coincidentally at the time of the Arab Spring – I overthrow my life. It’s time to live abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p>It&#8217;s months after Bohol that it hits me: had I been duped? What were the band hiding behind the shades? Blindness, … or sight? It dawns on me that it&#8217;s probably a scam. I’d seen the light: I was had!</p>
<p>At Cebu airport, a year later, I catch sight of another blind band through the opening from a door left ajar, sat around waiting to be ushered to stage. Once again, I’m an audience of one. Only, this time, I’m not observing the band perform. They think they’re safely alone, free to use all their faculties. But are they blind or not? Had my Massachusetts moment been an illusion? Was I wise to have been cynical? Clever, yes; but wise?</p>
<p>Is cynicism a strength or weakness?</p>
<p>I study them from afar, and I get my answer.</p>
<p>-END-</p>

<blockquote><p>Hidden among the 85 million people and the 7,100 islands of the Philippines are an estimated half a million people who are blind, and many more who are visually impaired to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>By far, the leading cause of blindness among adults in the Philippines is cataract, accounting for around 400,000 cases. The treatment for cataract is simple and effective but is not readily available or affordable for those living in the rural areas.</p>
<p>Perhaps up to one hundred children lose their sight every week in the Philippines. Almost half of these cases are either treatable or preventable. Poor nutrition, measles, and premature birth are among the leading causes of preventable blindness in children. Early detection and treatment are the keys to saving the sight of these children.</p>

					<p><a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/1910107_506533641047_2726_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2197 aligncenter" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/1910107_506533641047_2726_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="1910107_506533641047_2726_n" width="300" height="225" /></a> The first Koreans I met were in Xi’an, China. They were missionaries and so was I. We had bubble tea on a university street on a hot evening and talked about miracles. Mean little homeless cats stalked across the Lazy Susan on the café table. The Koreans, a young couple, were mildly concerned about the state of my salvation because I wasn’t Catholic, like they were. The police deported them the next day for proselytizing, which is officially illegal in the country. I forget their names now.</p>
<p>This was summer 2007. It was my first trip to Asia and I’d flown over with eleven other bible college students. White saviors, there to do the Lord’s work. To witness to the locals and show them the signpost to salvation. After seven weeks of laying groundwork we’d leave, pushing them off on their own like kids on a bike, reinforcing them from the other hemisphere with the power of prayer. Hoping they’d start a church or something and that the conversion rate would grow exponentially in our wake.</p>
<p>To get visa approval we had to go “undercover” as university students enrolled in a Mandarin speaking course. We were coached by our school’s Student Missionary Union to stay off Facebook in the country, because that would expose our links to the church. And not to use the words “Jesus” or “missionary” in public, in case the local police overheard us. All of this was enough to allow myself to indulge in daydreams of espionage, of being an international renegade infiltrating a secular Communist bloc. I remember the rush of wrapping my Bible up in T-shirt and burying it deep in my suitcase like I was smuggling a 9mm Beretta through immigration. I was James Bond, if James Bond were a nineteen year-old American Christian who had never kissed a girl and didn’t know what beer tasted like.</p>
<p>So it was a vice-free excursion. No alcohol or nightlife. But that was fine; at that point I didn&#8217;t know what I was missing. Lights out at 10:30, after prayer meetings and four-chord worship songs strummed by our team leader. During the day we’d entrap college students by hosting huge ultimate Frisbee games on the quad. The goal was to make friends, invite them to coffee, then slowly sneak in our message during conversation, which we&#8217;d direct toward the topics of passions and dreams. <a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/1910233_506663695417_7316_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2198 aligncenter" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/1910233_506663695417_7316_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="1910233_506663695417_7316_n" width="300" height="200" /></a> I didn’t really bother with any of that. I was happier sticking with the leisurely perks of a summer abroad; tearing into a plate of dumplings on the street and posing in front of pagodas wearing aviators. I didn’t consciously acknowledge it until years later, when I got a little separation from it all, but I was a fraud that whole summer, as I had been from the jump. A wholly insincere Christian, only really enlisting as part of the flock because it was all I knew. Evangelism wasn’t a priority. I just went on the trip to impress girls from church and to compile a Facebook album.</p>
<p>I was less of a human being than I was a wellspring of arrogance, this being courtesy of a stilted worldview and a perception narrowed to the width of a sniper scope. Mine was an untested, unchallenged childhood spent behind a shield. Comfortably inside the middle-class Baptist bubble. I look at American soldiers in Seoul and trust-fund backpackers in the Philippines and many of them regard the planet with same superior smirk that I used to. Seeing each country as some quaint destination that exists for our amusement. Or yet another place populated by natives in need of our ideology.</p>
<p>I was the <em>rebel</em> of the team, because I’d vault the campus fence at midnight and go on six or seven-mile runs through Xi’an. Past the Drum Tower inside the old city wall or through the alleys in the Muslim quarter. Or through the red light district, where the girls carrying trays in dive bars wore shorts that showed their ass cheeks. A new sight, for me. The filth in the underworld was almost impressive: the decades of grime packed into the grooves of the sidewalks, the rolling hills of trash and the grease slicked all over the steel walkways twisting overhead. Old women in shapeless clothes just squatted and shit wherever they happened to be walking. <a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/night-time-below-drum-tower-xian-china.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2199 aligncenter" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/night-time-below-drum-tower-xian-china.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="night-time-below-drum-tower-xian-china" width="300" height="216" /></a> Every run was another spin of the kaleidoscope. Sweaty taxi drivers on break tipping back flasks of <em>baijiu</em>, one of whom casually vomited in his cupholder as I went past, as if this was standard operating procedure. I spent a lot of nights out there, pounding through the city. My curiosity impelled me; I’d come all this way, I wanted to see something real.</p>
<p>And I did. There was the night a guy had his girlfriend pinned in front of a bar with her arm corkscrewed behind her back. He was knocking her head sideways with open-hand slaps as I came around the corner. The other drinkers all sat nearby and sipped. I’d never been in a fight; I don’t even think I’d ever seen someone get hit. He yelled at me to go away and I did. I still think about that moment.</p>
<p>Xi’an in the country’s old capital. Like any Chinese metropolis, it’s the real deal and makes Western cities look adorable. Its towers spawn out into infinity. Some people look at a city like this and regard it with urgency, because they see eight million people who are damned unless they can reach them all. I was wondering who could reasonably expect us to do such a thing.</p>
<p>I got lost in the sprawl some nights and the humidity would force to me to a stop. If you ever slowed down, then groups of kids on canes came up to ask for money. Most of them had been maimed by local bosses or whoever organized the begging racket. There were little girls whose legs had been broken and reset so they healed backward. Slumdog Millionaire schemes. If Jesus loved them, he had a strange way of showing it. On Wednesdays we went to an orphanage and took the disabled kids with swollen heads swimming. They liked to be held weightless on the surface of the water. Doing this made me feel helpless. Against ugliness, against all this cold chaos I kept witnessing. All these vignettes were adding up to something. They put deep cracks in my foundation and forced me to a point of honesty.</p>
<p>It’s been eight years since then and now I drink. Now I don’t believe in Heaven or a guy who decides if you get to go there. Billions still do, but I don’t necessarily begrudge them that. Someone has to go to the orphanage. What has kept surprising me is that, despite all the warnings of the emptiness that tortures the lost souls on the other side of the fence, I’m more fulfilled now. <a href="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/south-korean-church-crosses.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2200 aligncenter" src="https://sweetpicklesandcorn.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/south-korean-church-crosses.jpg?w=300&#038;h=156" alt="south-korean-church-crosses" width="300" height="156" /></a> Now I’m back in Asia. There’s a stretch of road near my villa here in Korea that I&#8217;ve learned to avoid because it’s a missionary hunting ground. Enter the zone between the golf driving range and that glassy new hospital and you’re straying into the confluence of three churches. Right in the middle of overlapping fields of fire. You can feel the neon crosses tracking you like target reticles. The Christians always dress smartly and they’re quite clever; they’ll stop you to ask for help with “Englishee homework” before quick-drawing a Bible and beckoning you inside the church to hear the “Secret of the Passover.” My fellow expats will relate. Sometimes blond Mormons from Utah will come up and I’ll shoot the shit with them just to enjoy a rare sober conversation with a foreigner. Twice, cars have shuddered to a stop next to me and their drivers have rushed up with leaflets. I empathize with their urgency. They care about my salvation. I guess in a way it’s kind of nice that someone does.</p>

<p>By John Bocskay When Typhoon Sanba slammed into Busan in 2012 I had my face pressed to the window of my 10th floor apartment in Haeundae Marine City, watching as great roiling waves crashed over the sea wall and raced up the street past my building.

<p>From February to June 1787, with all of his necessities packed in a single trunk, Thomas Jefferson traveled &#8220;incognito&#8221; by coach, barge, and sometimes mule across most of France and Northern Italy. Reading the extensive diary he kept of the trip, one encounters many passages like the following. In the boudoir at Chanteloup is an ingenious [&hellip;]</p>

<p>by Eli Toast So I’m sleeping in fifth gear and lurch awake as if I’ve accidentally down-shifted into first. I run to my kitchen which stinks like hot batteries. The electric stove is glowing orange, the refrigerator door is open, and the shelves are collapsed inside. As my panic ebbs, I await the inevitable emotional [&hellip;]</p>

<p>by Pablo Harris Abespectacled non-descript middle-aged man slouched in a chair, clutching a highball, is staring at a laptop screen on the desk in front of him. Alessandra, a twenty-something brunette with shoulder-length kinky hair, approaches Raymond. She stands in profile just two steps away staring at him.
