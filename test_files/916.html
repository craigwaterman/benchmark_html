  Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Blog!</p>
<p>I hope to attract people who ask questions   about anything, wanting proof of answers that are logical and   reasonable. I am from Mumbai.</p>
<p>I have been involved with banking   sector who probe deeply into ultra-modern thoughts that have not spread   very far but are supported by credentialed scientists and specialists.</p>
<p>My   blog might not be interesting to many, but, if it goes along as I hope,   it might be interesting to a few folks who have open minds that will   consider any thought that might make it to here.</p>
<p>Try it out!</p>
