				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Let&#8217;s look on the bright side,&#8221; said Father, &#8220;Wot can&#8217;t be `elped must be endured. Each cloud `as a silvery lining, And we did `ave young Albert insured.</p>
<p>From <em>Albert’s Return</em> by Marriott Edgar</p>
<p>You might not think so – I certainly didn’t before all this – that chemo can bring certain benefits.  Well, I can’t speak for all chemos, nor can I speak for everyone on chemo.  Just my particular cocktail and my body’s response to it.  And neither of these things were really in my control.  But put together I have experienced some not-wholly-unpleasant physical side effects.</p>
<p>I take a bit of comfort in these developments because, quite frankly, I have no way of knowing if the chemo is effective at its primary job (fending off future cancers).  A chemotherapy’s effectiveness can only be traced on visible tumors – if effective, the tumor will shrink.  Since I had no visible tumors after surgery, we will only know, down the road, if chemo was i<em>neffective</em> (because metastases reveal themselves); we’ll never know if chemo was <em>effective</em> because there’s something like a 60% chance that I have no stray nasty cells wandering around looking for vulnerable organs to implant in.  In other words, if I don&#8217;t get a recurrence, it could be because the chemo was effective.  Or it could be because I never had any possibility of recurrence in the first place.</p>
<p>(One upside of chemo right there: learning what population health statistics mean).</p>
<p>So, on to what I can measure, and – what the hell, why not? – take a cheery view of.</p>
<p><em>Hair there, hair gone:</em> You probably know about the hair loss, even if you have not seen me lately.  My hair is gone, gone, gone.  It’s ALL gone (but not perfectly so, of course, because nothing or no one is perfect).  The upside? No need to spend money on a Brazilian wax!</p>
<p>Yes, I know you’re curious about that.  Everyone is.  So, for the record, when the hair on your head goes, it goes everywhere else, too (again not entirely completely).</p>
<p>My eyebrows, my eye lashes: all history! I like this look. Enough so that I may well take effort and go to expense when everything grows back to artificially maintain it.  Maybe not the vanishing eyelash act, because that’s a tiny bit creepy-looking.  But definitely I will, in the future, pay the good money that women conventionally do so to keep things under control.</p>
<p>Okay, so losing my nasal hairs is kind of a drag, because without them and without eyelashes there’s nothing to retain the prodigious volume of water that chemo also, for some reason, causes me to produce.  But looking like you’re crying all the time can earn some extra sympathy points from pure strangers like, say, the traffic cop who didn’t ticket me after I rolled a stop sign in March.  Weeping and bald, I looked like a chemo patient (which I am, of course).  So the cop just handed me back my license and a warm wish to feel better soon (it probably didn’t hurt that I’m white and drive a middle-class-looking car).</p>
<p><em>Chemo hits your nails, too.</em>  So no need to budget for manicures.  Plus my drugs (I think it’s the Taxotere) give me an unusual effect: self-coloring nails.  Okay, the color is not great (it’s a sort of reddish tan underneath the nail bed) and it’s not particularly even (not unlike the hair thing).  But if you can get beyond the color, then the effect is kind of cool: stripey nails.  People might pay money for this look (I can’t imagine they would, but maybe…).</p>
<p><em>Colorless lips and a rosy complexion:</em> The chemical assault on my red blood cells promptly drained the color right out of my lips and my gums. Picture one of those very light, seasonal lipsticks and you can imagine the subtleness of the effect.  On the other hand – I don’t know if it’s the steroids, or one of the chemo drugs themselves – but I have a bit more color than usual in my face.  A bit blotchy in distribution, but a bright color nonetheless.</p>
<p><em>A little more weight is supposed to be good for middle-age women:</em> Or so I’m told, in that it helps fight the osteoporosis that I will soon be a risk of.  Mind you, I don’t enjoy putting on weight, but I’m trying to find a bright side here.</p>
<p>My vision of myself on chemo was not pretty: I understood that with my treatment plan I would go bald and that I would pack on the pounds (up to 25 lbs!).  Because I have a tiny head and small frame (with already fragile and light-weight bones), I envisioned the effect of a fattened, hairless version of myself as a tick.  Yes: a bloated tick.  Blessedly, it’s not that bad.  And really, what’s a few pounds (only 10 at this point)?</p>
<p>So, I’m heading toward portly but getting there smooth-skinned.  On balance, that’s not too terrible.</p>
<p><em>Self-warming:</em> from the hot flashes.  But it doesn’t last long enough to have cut our heat bill much this winter.</p>
<p><em>An enviable ability to nap:</em> I may as well own this –I’m pretty tired a lot of the time.  But that means I can drop off to sleep in the middle of the day with nary any effort.  And bounce back pretty fast too!</p>
<p>What I’ve learned from all this? Hell yes, I can do chemo.  And I have just two more rounds to go before I get to experience my body slowly returning to its much hairier, less roly-poly (well hopefully anyway) self.</p>

<p><em>Cancer is not the dog</em><br />
In the early days, I went to see my oncologist a few times to try to persuade her to persuade my surgeon that I needed more surgeries – to remove (why not?) a butt-load of body parts and organs that to me seemed likely candidates for future unpleasantness. My father, who retired from his university appointment as a surgical oncologist around &#8211; lemme think, 1990 – coached me to do so from the sidelines. His bench had not really had players on it for 20 years. But never mind. He gave me a simple and persistent message: get more surgeries. Get ALL the surgeries (??). Dutifully, I did my daughterly best from 700 miles away to try to fill that prescription.</p>
<p>My oncologist patiently (or maybe not so) went over the latest clinical data: Only women under the age of 40 with my triple positive breast cancer (two hormones and a particularly unpleasant genetic mutation) would be advised to yank out all the reproductive plumbing. And as for a double radical mastectomy, it would not change my chances, statistically, of reducing a recurrence. I had had enough surgery, at this point, according to a comparison of my pathology to the statistics of other cancer patients like me. The excision of my little orange-section-like slice of breast tissue, with its clean margins and no infected lymph nodes plus a few weeks in the cancer center’s fancy tanning bed would do just as well to prevent recurrence as would a monster surgery to hack off and then rebuild my (little) melons (my words, not the doctor’s).</p>
<p>I looked unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Don’t let the tail wag the dog,” my oncologist advised. I was stumped. I understood the reference, but couldn&#8217;t figure out whether cancer was the tail or the dog. It’s the dog, right? Because it’s the thing dictating every step of my life from here on out. “The tail,” my oncologist said, was my cancer. I was clearly letting the tail wag the dog, so much so that I couldn’t tell where dog ended and tail began. According to my doctor, if I let the tail (cancer) wag the dog (the rest of my body), I’d wind up unnecessarily removing many components of the animal (i.e., me) in order to satisfy the impulses of its tail.</p>
<p>“Cancer is everything to you right now” she said, (or something like that). She read me like a book, noting that I see cancer everywhere, and that seeing it everywhere shapes how I think about everything. “You will go to Thanksgiving” (which was days away from our conversation) “and wonder if it will be your last” (I did! I was thinking just that!). She didn’t budge. She understood what I didn’t: that I understood EVERYTHING reflected through the light-bending lens of my cancer. And everywhere I saw the optical illusion of cancer lurking in my body, I wanted to snuff it out, extinguish it, turn off its power source.</p>
<p>So like a dimwitted dog chasing its own tail, I kept circling back to surgery: “Because I have cancer…,” I started in again. She cut me off: “You HAD cancer. You had it taken out. So you don’t have cancer anymore. Now we are going to keep it from coming back.” My turn (caught off guard): “But what about the micro metastases” (that my biologist mother had so inelegantly called ‘mets’ in a long email to me that she probably wrote from her lab)? Reply: “We don’t know that you have any and that’s what the chemo will go after.”</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>Of course it was not for me. Unsatisfied, I next drove halfway across the state to get the same message, multiple times, over the course of an entire day, from a large (and very nice) team of doctors at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>And only then did I get my cancer dog to obey me and ignore its tail.</p>
<p>You can’t say I was not thorough.</p>
<p><em>Cancer is the metanarrative</em><br />
There’s nothing original in noting that cancer is metaphoric. Physicians and patients have been doing so for a long a time. Indeed, the first clinical descriptions of tumors made use of metaphors – the technique of describing one thing by using the figure of something familiar; in so doing the two things became the same(ish).</p>
<p>And this conversation with my doctor was not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I grasped cancer as a metaphor. I don’t mean simply that I grasped cancer through a metaphor (which I did). Rather, I mean that cancer itself is a metaphor. Of course my doctor used a metaphor to get me to understand something that I had become utterly incapable of understanding. And it worked (eventually)!</p>
<p>But in a more comprehensive sense, what I really understood is what my friend Kristina Wirtz, a linguist, might call the metanarrative of cancer: that cancer is, itself, a master (or über) metaphor. Of what? Well, of everything. Everything that we don’t understand, but is looming, growing fast and that we feel mortally threatened by. So when we encounter something that seems wildly out of control, unstoppable, governed by its own perverse colonizing logic and, ultimately, deadly, we invoke the metaphor of something laden in scientific and medical language that is wildly out of control, unstoppable, governed by its own perverse colonizing logic and, ultimately, deadly.</p>
<p>At this point, I pause and Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em> comes to mind, as does Karl Marx’s <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, and in particular Joseph Schumpeter’s <em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democra</em>cy with Schumpeter’s inimitable (and admiring) description of the business cycle as “creative destruction.” That unfettered economic change comes to mind when I think about cancer reveals how cancer works as a metanarrative: it is the total explanation, the whole story, under which all other stories rest and make sense. It becomes the metaphor for and of the things that we use it to explain it. I can’t think about cancer and not think about, as well, the economy, which is very cancerous (good news for some, not for others).</p>
<p>See how this happens? We need metaphors to explain cancer, but cancer itself is already a metaphor because metaphors are equivalent to what we understand cancer to be (which we have understood mostly through metaphors). This is a process that is both, weirdly, evolving and static. I was steeped in cancer metaphors long before I began to grow my own little baby monsters. And then I came to understand their growth and how to abort them through the metaphors used to explain and guide patients in their encounter with this thing that we already, kind of, but only through metaphor, know.</p>
<p>And as my knowledge of the biology of cancer evolves (through the trick of explaining by analogy because most of the scientific and clinical literature is utterly opaque to me), then my metaphors become more involved.</p>
<p>Of course my oncologist is right that for the cancer patient, cancer is a metanarrative. But it’s a metanarrative for many people in the modern world who have never had cancer, never even been around it. Cancer is that saturated in meaning; it’s that large and self-referential (through metaphors of things that are not cancer) that we can use it to characterize particularly troubling social and natural phenomena that have nothing, directly, to do with rogue cells in a discrete vertebrate (I’m told that plants don’t get cancer. But that’s a matter for another discussion).</p>
<p>The linguist George Lakoff has showed many times that metaphors possess power; in fact, “metaphors can kill” he claims.<a title="" href="#_edn1">[1]</a>  Even shy of inflicting a mortal wound, the language that we use to describe illness has etiological effects, according to Susan Sontag who learned through her own experience with breast cancer that “the very reputation of this illness added to the suffering of those who have it.”<a title="" href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>But the cancer establishment does not entirely feel comfortable with its war of words.  It has come to recognize what your average English major (that’s me!) or poet long ago learned: that metaphors shape how people feel and therefore act (points made more elegantly by Lakoff and Sontag).  Clinicians recognize that powerful weaponry in their words and so some have sustained concerted effort – evident in cancer education, journals and elsewhere – to sensitize practitioners to choose their metaphors carefully.  Steer away from the language of war, because the victor, sometimes, is not the patient.  And it’s quite silly to say, in the end, that “she lost her battle” because of course in such sad instances, the victor died, too (cue the opening heart-tugging strains of “One Tin Soldier”).</p>
<p><em>The war of words of cancer</em></p>
<p>Even as some clinicians some of the time try to steer patients into other metaphoric terrains, the metaphor of cancer as a war, as a fight for survival of the body, has a life of its own (much like a tumor that lives on in the rogue cells that it sends out as little sentries and colonizers to new territories of the body).  So, unsurprisingly, it’s useful for whipping up the social adrenalin required for drawn-out resource-depleting battles whose outcomes will (supposedly) determine survival of the body politic.</p>
<p>Not that long ago (Nov. 2009), President Obama called Al Qaeda a cancer: &#8220;We&#8217;re in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country.” And just like a real – and not metaphoric cancer – Al Qaeda presents metastatic growth.  He continued: “But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.&#8221;<a title="" href="#_edn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Even more recently, (Sept. 2011) Mexico’s President Felipe Calderon made use of the cancer metaphor to defend his widely criticized efforts to pacify competing drug organization’s violent turf battles across Mexico.  He noted: &#8220;The only way to end this cancer is to continue with our (military) strategy.&#8221;<a title="" href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>We always circle back around; we are always the dog chasing its own tail, trapped as we are in the metanarrative of cancer.  Cancer is totalizing, and it&#8217;s a totalizing metaphor; it’s a metanarrative.  That is why, in case it’s not already clear to you – dear reader – that I can’t shake from this blog all the ways and places that I see cancer now.  It’s my way of (ahem) fighting my battle.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In early October, on a walk in our nearby woods, I spied a small fungus growing sideways from the canyon-like surface of a maple tree.  Fungi sprout all over trees in these woods.  But this particular colony caught my eye probably because of the tree’s position next to the trail and the light at this time of year – brightened by the seasonal shift from deep, dark green to an early fall palette of yellows.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_44" style="width: 191px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://thebigandlittlec.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fungi1b1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-44" title="Fungi1b" src="https://thebigandlittlec.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fungi1b1.jpg?w=181&#038;h=300" alt="" width="181" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pretty as a Wart</p></div>
<p>For days, I rounded the bend in the path that brought me squarely eye-level with the growing fungus, always wishing I had remembered to bring a camera.  The image looked absurd and selfish: like a wart that doesn’t recognize its own unattractiveness.</p>
<p>Soon after I began smirking at the fungus, I learned that my right breast harbored a killer guest.  Promptly, of course, the fungus became a metaphor for my cancer every time I walked by it.  And an internal discussion would ensue about how imperfect the metaphor was.  After all, fungus colonization of the tree is obvious and superficial: it grows atop, not inside, its host (apparently so, at any rate).</p>
<p>There are many things about my cancer that initially warranted cheerfulness: it was smallish, (1.5 cm), had clean margins, and had not penetrated any lymph nodes.  It also tested positive for receptivity to estrogen and progesterone, which means that turning off or blocking those hormones lessens chances of recurrence.  All good.  But a third test &#8211; the one that winds up being the single most important characteristic of breast cancer &#8211; came back, initially, “equivalent.”  The hospital’s pathology lab sent my tumor sample on to another lab for a more definitive test of what is called “Her2.”</p>
<p>For a few days – maybe a week – I carried the hope that my Her2 status would resolve to “negative.” Equivalency – between two definitive states – gave me good reason to imagine that the balance would be worked out in my favor.  This did not happen.  Before we met with the surgeon for our discussion of the removal of my tumor, the second test – the FISH test it’s called – determined that my tumor was indeed, Her2 positive.</p>
<p>Her2, stands for “human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2”; all my cells – and yours – have such receptors.  These growth factors (a whole family of them!) lie on the surface of all our cells, a feature of their skin and how, therefore, cells grow and proliferate.  In tumor cells, where lots of normal things about cells are just not normal, an overexpression – too much of an ordinary thing – is just not a good thing.   Here’s why, as one clinical study put it: too much Her2 “inhibits aptosis (programmed cell death).”</p>
<p>I learned only recently, as I began doing my homework to understand how to confront my very changed existence with myself, that cell death is normal.  Of course it is.  But cancer cells just don’t die.  They possess, in fact, a form of immortality, which is why – I suppose – cancers can just grow and grow and grow.  Ordinary cells possess “programs” to die; cancer cells do not (little fuckers).</p>
<p>Digesting my knowledge of what it means to have too much epidermal growth factor in my tumor, I also became obsessed with the fungus in the woods.  (My friend, Nicole, and my sister, Lana, can attest to this).  After my surgery I watched my fungus shrink over the course of a couple of dry weeks, only to revive again after a day of good rain.  And I cheered this development (it turns out that I’m stupidly sentimental about fungi).  The fungus shriveled and expanded in response to moisture; with rain it could avoid death.  I wondered, as I watched its progress toward death and then life, which way it would head, definitively.  As fall marched onto winter, colder but dry days nearly disappeared my fungus.  I found it difficult to keep track of.  I had to hunt long and hard along the bumpy surfaces of many look-a-like trees to find it.   Last I checked, this morning, it was still there, though dead or alive I cannot say.</p>
<p>And I thought more about my analogy: it had grown stronger in some respects, because the surface of my cancer really held/holds the key to my cancer-free future, or what might be my death by cancer.  Likewise the fungus situated on the surface of this maple tree that takes in water through its surface might well govern how its host will die, some day.</p>
<p>Fungi are primary decomposers; they are the organisms that do the initial work of turning formally living forest plants and animals into dirt and nutrients.  They don’t have to wait for trees to die, of course.  They can set in upon living trees.  Planted atop a healthy tree, like the tiny potential cancer cells deep in my body before they became cancer, fungi can live symbiotically and epiphenomenally at the surface. But, vampirically, fungi penetrate with tiny tentacles, drawing life from their hosts and leaving behind bits of death.  Their work is constant: a good colony can establish itself on the surface of a tree and soon render it spongy, soft and vulnerable.</p>
<p>I don’t really know much about fungi.  I don’t, in fact, know whether the fungus I watched wax and wane over several weeks, hanging on the bark of a pretty sturdy-looking maple tree, was doing the tree any damage.  I don’t know much about breast cancer, either.  I don’t know how long I had mine.  But I can’t help but think about the amazing beauty of the organism I can see while I think about the mysterious, spectacular and powerful one that I can’t.  I admire the delicate gill-like structure of my fungus’ underside and how it filled plump and fat with water after our one good October rain.  I’m told that my cancer is “very smart,” by my oncologist because it has figured out a means to grow and grow and grow.</p>
<p>As my fungus disappeared, I found a much larger, more robust colony nearby to follow and take (bad) pictures of.  Fungi in the forest will go on, as long as there is leaf litter, tree trunks and other plant matter for them to feed upon.  And rain to inflate them.  My cancer, hopefully, will not.  And if it does, &#8220;smart&#8221; is not the word I would use to describe it: indeed, “self-destructive” makes more sense to me. Because unlike fungi that can reproduce outside of themselves and their hosts, my cancer – if it’s spectacularly stupid in the way that self-destructive beings are &#8211; and I (who is not so stupid, I don&#8217;t think) are versions only of each other and will be doomed together.</p>

<p>One more thing about fungi that I like of late: the second pumpkin I carved for Halloween did little to impress at first.  I freehanded a bat (Georgia’s suggestion) and then, far too quickly for a good execution, hacked out my design.  Halloween came and went that night.  Over the course of the next three weeks, the inside of the pumpkin darkened and turned slick with a shiny coating of black fungus – the work of decomposition that enlivens the tiny spores that had settled happily inside my dying pumpkin.   In the process of decomposing pumpkin flesh, the fungi made the most remarkable bat-o-lantern that I could have hoped for.  Slowly, gradually, an image of a flying bat emerged in deep relief on the sculpted surface of the pumpkin, showing in the end that my drawing was not half-bad after all, and looking like an accident of nature that had been planned, all along.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>On the afternoon of Oct. 31<sup>st</sup>, I rushed to get my kids home early.  We had pumpkins to carve! Final details on their costumes! A dog to walk! And, by the way, I also had a 6:30 am appointment at the hospital the following day for my – ahem – breast cancer surgery.  The night promised to be busy.</p>
<p>Michigan had a super wet summer and so we found really big – and cheap – pumpkins this year.  They had fat, thick stems.  And this year their waxy golden surfaces looked especially promising before the first incision.  Of course the outcomes, no matter whether we cheat and trace a downloaded or purchased pattern or draw designs free-hand, never quite meet with our vision of how cool carved pumpkins should look.  What is that makes jack-o-lanterns so hard to successfully execute?</p>
<p>We bought some inexpensive carving tools last year and they make some parts of the job less challenging.  Their little serrated blades help to saw smaller and more precise cuts.  But because knives really are cheap, they wobble and flex when confronted with tough pumpkin flesh.  Many of our incisions display strange contours.  On the surface, the cuts all look more or less like their intended design.  But inside, the little knives catch crazy angles, so that some holes are not really holes at all, but awkward slits through which no candlelight can shine.  Each time I poorly execute a cut, I go back and saw away vigorously at pumpkin flesh, trying to widen the light-letting holes but also making hash of the design.  You can’t help but slash off delicate angles when you began hacking at fibrous squash tissue.</p>
<p>As I worked away at the massive pumpkins, with our pathetic little knife set, my surgeon’s description of my pending procedure ran through my mind. I instantly hoped she would do better on me than I was doing on my poor defenseless pumpkin.</p>
<p>I had figured she’d open me up, get in there and start poking around at anything that looked suspicious and just take it all out.  This is not at all how things work.  She would go only after a very targeted area and not even see the rest of my breast.</p>
<p>In the area of concern she would home in on the tumor.  She would slice it out, and carefully remove just enough tissue around it to make sure she scooped up any cancer cells that she could not detect visually.  She also would take out up to three lymph nodes.  The tumor I pictured large enough to make finding and excising easy.  But as my little knives became jammed in tough pumpkin sides and failed to penetrate all the way through the fruit’s tough structure, I couldn’t help but think of parallel challenges: how easy would it be for my surgeon to find the target tissue, slice it cleanly away from the healthy breast and not leave tiny traces behind?  And if she got it all, could she do so without poking jagged holes?</p>
<p>The tumor was no longer, to me, self-contained and self-evident, but entangled and enmeshed.  It became every imaginable fruit or vegetable that I’d ever inelegantly laid a knife upon.  Was it like the pit of a ripe peach? Caught in a web of by fibrous peach flesh and resistant to removal?</p>
<p>I tortured myself for a moment with these thoughts and then considered: a) I am a mammal and not a plant; b) she has way better knives than a $2.00 set from the Dollar Store; and c) she does this all the time, with really sharp and strong knives while I carve pumpkins with crappy knives but once a year.</p>
<p>Despite the limits of my tools, one of my two pumpkin efforts did not turn out so horrible (for the record, I drew the design myself).  And the surgery, we were told, also went splendidly.   But more on that, later.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Picture a newish, room-sized photocopying machine.  Now loop its ends together: you have made an enormous photocopier in the shape of a donut.  Place a narrow, cushion-less hospital bed at the bottom of the donut hole.  Replace that messy toner cartridge with magnets.  Now you have an MRI machine.</p>
<p>To enter your human photocopier, you once again disrobe and gown-up in yet more flattering hospital garb, this time with some oversized pajama bottoms.  I peeked at the linen shelves in my changing room.  It’s all 2x and larger.  Belt these oversized garments as best you can.  Once again, modesty is a charade.  The empress has been given a hospital gown.  But you soldier on, with great folds of blue cloth swirling awkwardly about you.</p>
<p>Use the restroom, per instructions, because you will be told that you’ll be in the photocopier for “a long time” and that if you need to get up for any reason “they’ll have to start it all over from the beginning.” “How long is long?” you ask, because you had imagined that your photocopy would be quick and snappy, just like a sheet of paper.  “About an hour” the guy tells you.  This is news.  And like so much of what you are experiencing for the first time, in all of this, not the best kind.  But it’s just an hour.  An hour you can handle, right? An hour during which you must lie <em>absolutely still</em>.</p>
<p>You learned last night that “the machine is pretty noisy.” And that other friends have taken calming drugs – Xanax, Valium, even Benadryl.  You have none of these available and are entering this experience with only your own calming abilities to keep your freakout level low.  These abilities are getting a real workout these days.  So you hope that they can rise to today’s challenge.</p>
<p>You fill out some paperwork.  More of the same questions you were asked in your doctor’s office before this mess all started.  In the radiology lab when you got the first jolt.  In the surgeon’s office two weeks later.  And now, in the MRI lab.  You’ve answered these same questions the same way for years: allergies, chronic conditions, surgeries, serious illnesses and so on.  Up ‘til now there was very little to report.  Nothing of significance.  You realize that this may well be the last time you fill out a medical history form in this way, with so little to report.  The next time you face a medical history form – say, next week – will have to say that you have had breast cancer and breast surgery.  And then by the end of the year, you may also note that you’ve had radiation therapy, chemo, maybe reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>You feel a tiny bit nostalgic for that old history form, the one that you will never fill out again.  The one that is now the history of yourself as a healthy person.</p>
<p>A tech walks you to the photocopier room, taking away your phone and glasses.  Your hands are now empty, your is vision now blurred.  You have only your thoughts to occupy and keep you company.  You park in a chair with nothing but your blue robes as a defense while the tech jabs your arm quickly to hook you up to radioactive fluid that will allow your cancer cells to “light up” in the machine.  You look at the drip and think to yourself that running poisons through your body will be very routine in the very near future.</p>
<p>That tech disappears and another tech comes in to load you onto that crazy narrow and cushion-less bed. The bed is really just a frame with cut-out holes for your various body parts.  You have the IV tethered to your arm and wrapped around your hand, and you have to move a mountain of fabric before you can actually move yourself.  So it is not easy to climb onto the &#8220;bed.&#8221;  But you manage.</p>
<p>Then you slide your face into the frame that suspends your head still and stare down at a mirror that gives you, briefly, the impression that you are suspended over a hole in the floor and looking deep into a basement room several floors below which looks oddly like the ceiling of the room you’re in.  This optical illusion keeps your mind busy while the tech fusses your boobs into their own frames.</p>
<p>There’s a dull humming in the room.  “It’ll get louder when the scans are going,” she says.  She stuffs earplugs into your ears.  Panic momentarily sets in.  But the tech has nothing to offer you other than a panic bulb that you can squeeze if you really need to.  You remember, however, that you do NOT want to start this “whole” thing over from the beginning.</p>
<p>The tech leaves the room, closes the door.  A voice on a tiny tinny speaker from somewhere inside the copier donut hole tells you something about getting the machine ready to start.  “Squeeze the bulb if you find yourself uncomfortable and need to stop for any reason.” Like hell, I think.   A meditative calm sets in.</p>
<p>There’s a clock on the wall above the one-way window behind which (I presume) the tech sits.  I can see just the edge of it in the reflection on the floor below my suspended face.  I am dying to watch the passage of time – my hour in the copier – but don’t want to move even a facial muscle to adjust my view.</p>
<p>The tech whispers to me that the first scan is about to start, and will last about 5 and a half minutes.  I begin counting Mississippi’s.  The machine clicks and clacks.  The sound is certainly not deafening, and not deep and resonant, the way I had imagined magnets smashing into each other.  Sometimes the clicks and clacks are fast, sometimes slow. Sometimes, they send palpable shock waves into my cushion-less bed.  There seems to be no regular rhythm to the clicks and clacks.</p>
<p>My counting accuracy is so far off that I’m at 2 and half minutes when the machine stills and I’m told that the next scan –lasting about 15 seconds – is about to start.</p>
<p>We do a total of maybe 6 or 7 scans, of varying lengths.  For the last scan the tech tells me he will start the IV and that I might feel some cold and heaviness where the fluid enters my arm.  Again, I’m advised to squeeze the bulb, if needed.  Again, I think, like hell.</p>
<p>The final scan done, a third tech comes in to help me dismount the bed.  Even with the IV gone, this is less easy then mounting because I’ve been utterly immobile for half and hour with my arms stretched above my head.  She&#8217;s 8 months pregnant and obviously not inclined to help me much.  Which I understand.</p>
<p>I ask tech about the irregularity of the sounds the machine makes. “It’s just the physics of the magnets&#8217; she says, busy ushering me to the hallway.  “It sounds different with every scan.” Doesn’t sound very scientific to me, I think.</p>
<p>In the changing room I see my face.  Deep red creases score my cheekbones &#8211; from the pressure of the frame into which my head was suspended for half an hour.  I rub.  Nothing happens.  I think to myself: this is the face of MRI.  And thanks to my not very juvenile skin and its, ahem, inelasticity, MRI-face will stay with me the rest of the morning.   The beginning, I think to myself, of the physical signs that my body and I are locked in a mortal contest to defeat a very real inner demon.</p>

				<p>One week after my biopsy a nurse from my doctor’s office phones to follow-up my mammogram.  I’ll call her “Jenny.”</p>
<p>Some background is here helpful.  So far we have established that my right breast has a carcinogenic tumor.  The left breast is not, however, without its own worries. It presented with some deposits of calcification on the mammogram last week.  Before I headed off to the rest of that day’s probing and poking, the radiologist had already apprised me of my left breast’s curiosity and advised that I’d be returning in half a year for another picture of those possibly worrying deposits.</p>
<p>Our conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>Jenny: Hi! Just wanted to follow-up from your mammogram.  We have an order for a follow-up mammogram in six months.</p>
<p>Sarah: Huh.  Doesn’t my record say anything about the cancer diagnosis in my right breast?</p>
<p>Jenny: Oh…uh… gosh…</p>
<p>Sarah: So, I suppose we should wait to see if I have any breasts in six months before establishing I’ll need to go back for a follow-up mammogram, right?</p>
<p>Jenny:  (A little flustered).  Umm… I don’t see anything there…but they do want you back…</p>
<p>Sarah:  Yes. I understand.  If I have a breast. If I have any breasts.  Will I be having a mammogram if I don’t have any breasts?</p>
<p>Jenny: (still trying to get through her script): Well I guess they’ll make a recommendation at the time….we have you down for a follow-up….</p>
<p>For the record, I was laughing.  Jenny (poor thing) seemed duly uncomfortable with the conversation.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>It started with the mammogram.  The concerning breast –the one with the tender-to-the-touch lump went first: offered onto the cold plate of a large x-ray machine and squeezed unceremoniously between two icy bookends while I had to stand on my tippy toes to stay level with the heights to which my breast had been invited.  I can’t say I was not nervous.  I was.  But still: mammograms are absurd.  There you are whipping your breasts out of an ill-fitting bathrobe while someone acts like Julia Child and the Thanksgiving turkey, mashing your featherless, smooth, fleshy, floppy body parts into a chilled baking dish of sorts.  All while still attached to you.  You are both the studio audience and an appendage to the turkey.</p>
<p>This goes on for a few minutes and a few rounds of breast manipulation.  Then I get a break.  I’m back in the room with other middle-aged women.  Each in our attractive enormous blue gowns that don’t really stay shut.  But who cares? We all know that modesty in this setting is really for show.  I noticed that some women glance at each with recognition, the way you might if you saw the same people do a bank deposit every week.  But in a bathrobe that leaves your boobs sort of dangling.  It’s that kind of place.</p>
<p>Next I was invited to the sonogram room.  I was not particularly alarmed by this because I could feel the lump and I figured that they, like me, wanted to know more.</p>
<p>Cue the Windham Hill.<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>  Seriously.  Something like that was playing on a small boom box in the corner of the darkened, still room.  Probably to settle down the subject of what is otherwise an unnerving procedure.</p>
<p>I’d seen sonograms of both my children when they were but peanuts, and had no idea what the tech was looking at.  I knew I had a lump so I was not surprised that the tech massaged the dildo-like instrument back and forth for several minutes on top of what I could tell was a dark fleshy feature.  Back and forth.  Click. And so on.  Now my memory begins to feel less sure.  Was I sent out? Is this the first time I got to sit by myself in a special room? At some point the radiologist comes in with the tech and asks her to rub the dildo into my armpit.  I’m no dummy, I think.  They’re looking at my lymph nodes!  So I lie there feeling triumphantly smart.  But not really accepting that they are looking for tumors (doh!) in my lymph nodes.  They see nothing, apparently.  And I’m very smart.</p>
<p>Then I meet a very nice nurse.  She’s kind, lovely and tells me to wait in my special room while they confer on what happens next, and when: a needle biopsy.  And a set of instructions for preparing for that.  She leaves with my preferences for days and times to get that scheduled and the – “don’t worry but it’ll be a couple of weeks because of some sort of complication with the staff next week.”  Shit. I don&#8217;t want to disrupt my life.  But I’d prefer that they disrupt theirs so that we can settle this silly business once and for all.</p>
<p>Still not worried, right? Okay, I’m a little tense.  Probably more than a little tense.  I pull out my computer to do some grading.  This keeps my mind off what I might otherwise think.  So I don’t actually think what other women, sitting in this exam room, probably already figure out.</p>
<p>The nurse returns and tells me that she has pulled some strings and they can do the procedure right now! This is good, right? Or it’s very bad. I chose to think that it’s good.  They just want to be accommodating!</p>
<p>The doctor comes in.  The one who specializes in needle biopsies supported with ultrasound.  She does this all day, every day.  I start to think petty and catty thoughts.  She could use some more attractive glasses.  That’s all I can think about.  L.A. Eyeworks.  I want to send for more fashionable glasses.  I glance at her shoes.  Uh oh.  Those could use some help too.</p>
<p>Windham Hill still tinkling away.  I half expect scented candles.  But this is a hospital, not a gift shop.  The doctor is all business.  The nurse is suspiciously kind.  She rubs my arm and asks me about my family.  This of course alarms me and I squeeze back some tears and then tell myself I’m just getting a biopsy – right? It’s not like I have…..The doctor shoots a handheld harpoon at my breast.  Now I’m Moby Dick and she’s Ahab. I idly ask her the range of possibilities for her the outcome of her hunting expedition: “a cyst?.. a tumor?…” She abruptly stops me and says, “oh this is not a cyst. I’m positive it’s cancer.  It’s 99% surely cancer.” The nurse begins to gently massage my outstretched arms again.</p>
<p>Now I want to scream: THIS is how you tell someone she has cancer? By soft music, soft touch and little comforting coos? Oh my.  If I weren’t so shocked by this deeply unpleasant piece of information. I’d be laughing.  The nurses are all indirect.  The doctor could not be more direct.  I was thinking a middle ground between the two would be more, uh, advisable.</p>
<p>The rest is kind of a blur.  All the sudden I’m watching myself in a feature film that I didn’t realize I’d even tried out for the part of leading lady.  The doctor, who I later come to think is probably just not a people person, answers my questions straightforwardly:</p>
<p>“So, breast cancer is pretty common, right?”</p>
<p>“Less so before menopause.  Pre-menopausal cancers tend to be more aggressive. “</p>
<p>“I’m peri-menopausal.  Will that matter?”</p>
<p>“(Pause). No.  They tend to be just as aggressive peri-as pre-menopausal.”</p>
<p>“What happens next?”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out from the biopsy what kind and if it’s hormone receptive.  If it’s hormone receptive you’ll have not only that tumor removed, but your uterus and ovaries.”</p>
<p>This is all sounding fabulous! As a bonus to my breast surgery I’ll have menopause in a hot minute! And it’s not quite 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>I now understand that the nurse who has been kindly rubbing and cooing has been assigned as my nurse.  I like this.  She’s very kind and reassuring and hugs and sheds tears with me.  And we talk about my kids.  I tell her that’s what scares me most.  She says that’s what every mother says.  We cry a little more.  She must do this all the time.  Several times a day.  And yet, I feel that she sincerely cares about me and my very personal ordeal.</p>
<p>I gather up my things, including my breast cancer bag of information and equipment (pink gel packs to tuck into my bandages for the next 12 hours to help with the pain from the biopsy).  I have a book.  I have some discharge sheets.  They all say “BREAST CANCER BREAST CANCER BREAST CANCER BREAST CANCER.” I think to myself: there’s an entire BREAST CANCER industry out there that prints forms, writes and publishes manuals for patients, and manufactures pink gel ice packs.  This makes breast cancer and its treatment common and ordinary.  I’m going to be fine.  The BREAST CANCER INDUSTRY will see to it that I will be a successful product; I will survive.</p>
