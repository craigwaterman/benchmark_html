<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">What is the deal with short tight volleyball shorts for girls volleyball?</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br />
</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">My 4th grade daughter played in the first volleyball match of her career. My wife is the coach and she has been telling me that CC is a natural at volleyball. I had never seen CC play or even practice before today. Turns out my wife was right, CC was a star in a three game sweep. I was really not surprised that CC was good at volleyball too because she is a terrific little athlete. What did surprise me was that&nbsp;4th grade parochial school girls were wearing such&nbsp;short and tight uniforms. The school has a very strict and conservative uniform policy during school hours.</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br />
</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">This got me thinking. Why do women play volleyball in such short and tight shots? When did it start? I went on line to find out.</span><br />

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br />
</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Overall, the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091105124351AAbaQ8o"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Yahoo Answers</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;thread on the subject&nbsp;provided the same type answers but it still begged the question, "Why don't woman basketball players wear tight fitting uniforms. They jump, bend, twist and occasionally dive for loose balls.&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Vollygrl added that</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;"your long shorts can get caught in the net, which could get called against you." Now we have a competitive advantage reason that perhaps led to the decision for the use of the shorts because this net</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;violation costs a team a point and / or side-out.&nbsp;</span></span><br />

Stanford seemed to play great in baggy - knee length shorts when they won the NCAA Men's Volleyball Champion last year.</span></span><br />

<div style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; border-collapse: collapse; line-height: 18px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">So I read on hoping to find the answer. The "then why don't men wear short shorts argument" was prevalent. Some discussion threads suggest that it would not be appropriate for men to where tight shorts to play volleyball. Really, then why is it appropriate for Michael Phelps to wear a skin tight body swimsuit? Male swimmers do not care about offending anyone if a skin tight fitting swimsuit shaves off a split second to give them an edge.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; border-collapse: collapse; line-height: 18px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; border-collapse: collapse; line-height: 18px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">So believe me if tight shorts gave a volleyball player an edge then the men would be wearing them too.</span></div>
<div style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; border-collapse: collapse; line-height: 18px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; border-collapse: collapse; line-height: 18px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">So what is the reason? I could not find the answer, but it seemed to have started in the early 1970's. I found a website called </span><a href="http://nolefan.org/summary/wvpic.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Nolefan.org</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> that had pictures of Florida State University's women's volleyball teams from decade to decade. The 1969 women's team had long baggy shorts. The 1970 team had tight shorts and the shorts of today look no different from the shorts of 1972. (See pictures below) Perhaps, Nixon is the blame for this too.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br />
There is empirical evidence proving new high tech swimming suits make a swimmer faster, but there does not seem to be evidence that would suggest wearing tight volleyball pants makes a volleyball player play better. Short spandex shorts are for fashion only.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">From reading the discussion threads, I found that many of the bigger girls would rather not wear them. They are uncomfortable from a body image standpoint. I wonder how many girls with potential avoid playing the game because of the short shorts. If it were one it would be one too many.</span></span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">To be clear, I am not arguing for or against short shorts in volleyball. My personal opinion is that they are not necessary and young school girls should not wear them. My daughter thinks they are adorable, but she is a tiny.</span></span></div>

I need to purchase a few pairs for my daughter who starts club in January. :) I am a former volleyball player myself and was actually around for the turn from \46quot;baggy\46quot; to spandex.  I have my own personal archive of photos like the pic\46#39;s above.  I just had to weigh in because 1. I was a very athletic girl, you could assume rather stocky with huge legs for jumping higher than the other girl ;)), 2. I actually have worn them before to play and 3. I am a woman, who was a girl, and as far as the comments go, it seems like only men, specifically fathers, have the negative opinions regarding female attire.  In your research Stat Dad, I am unsure why you didn\46#39;t actually ask some coaches, or a national volleyball league representitive, seeing as they tend to set the standards. I attended private school, with a strict dress code, but by my senior year, we were all in spandex.  Our school won state, not because we were \46quot;distracting\46quot; the officials, but because we were good and the spandex, plain and simple, enable you to move without restriction.  I hate to hammer home a point, however, being a larger girl, I don\46#39;t know if you\46#39;ve ever heard the comment, \46quot;eat your shorts\46quot;??  Well, in ANY traditional (baggy) shorts, that\46#39;s exactly what my thighs do...they munch the WHOLE time, incredibly embarrassing.  Even now, I am a runner and I have to wear skin tight shorts/capris/or compression pants so I don\46#39;t eat my shorts all over town.  I agree with safeashouse, men and women, hate to draw attention to it, are different.  My husband does not, will not ever have to worry about shorts, or having kids.  My job, my department. ;)) Why don\46#39;t female beach volleyball players wear board shorts and go topless???? Need I say more on that...my point, comparison never really works unilaterally, just ask my kiddos ;)).  Spandex stay put while playing volleyball, and running for that matter, you don\46#39;t worry about tugging, twisting, billowing, munching shorts.  And trust me I did not have the body that would attract \46quot;revenue\46quot; in spandex, if anything they would have probably wanted to pay me to put on some sweats ;)).\74br /\76Donald, I would hate for you to make a decision for your daughter based on the \46quot;tightness\46quot; of shorts.  Girls should know that sports fall in to that awesome category where how you look doesn\46#39;t matter, it\46#39;s how you play the game.  Have her go longer 4\46quot;, or even 5\46quot;, and tell her to keep baggy shorts/sweat pants until it\46#39;s time to practice/play the game.  If she\46#39;s not running around town, sashaying in front of the boys, and wanting to wear them out to dinner with the fam, than Daddy, your good to go.  But if you can\46#39;t pry her out of them than....I hate to tell you, your problem is waaaaaaaay bigger than tight shorts.\74br /\76StatsDad-Your wife made the right call, longer does not hurt your ability to dive, roll, etc. I for one, whether it is baggy shorts being eaten or spandex being eaten, do not like to see butt cheek hanging out. :)) \74br /\76\74br /\76Have a great one!        \74br /\76\74br /\76I tried to sign in and post with my name, but it said I didn\46#39;t have access, go figure :)).  \74br /\76Janell from Central Cali', 'timestamp': '1323875750438', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751323875750438#c2714814613647506522', 'author': {'name': 'Anonymous', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif', 'profileUrl': ''}, 'displayTime': 'December 14, 2011 at 10:15 AM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1660151717'}, {'id': '5453482734659991689', 'body': 'Janell - thanks for your comment based on experience.

I play libero (back middle)and it is was easier to dive and roll without having to worry about my shorts coming up like they would with baggy shorts. many girls on my tesm want to wear the short I do because it is difficult to play with baggie shorts but like some of you their parents will not let them.

I am a woman who played volleyball in middle school in non-spandex shorts.  The issue of tightness \46amp; length are separate.  The argument that tight spandex helps performance (flexibility, out the way) seems valuable, but I see no value in the \46quot;shorts\46quot; that are basically the same as \46quot;boys cut underwear\46quot; i.e. less than 2-3\46quot; inseam.  I went to a tournament of 12-14y.o. recently, and was dismayed than 98% of the girls there were wearing these underwear in place of shorts.  One team had a few girls wearing spandex there were still short, but with a 4-6\46quot; inseam, which was such a relief!  \74br /\76\74br /\76There is a lot of room for shorts (spandex or otherwise) to cover between the crotch and the knee, and it should be used!  I saw lots of girls constantly picking their underwear/shorts from the front or back as they rode up or got sweaty \46amp; uncomfortable.  I believe players should wear uniforms that are comfortable \46amp; that they do not distract them--these short/underwear certainly distracted a number of girls I saw.  \74br /\76\74br /\76These underwear/short uniforms must discourage potential players who do not want to bend over, or even walk around half-naked, and that is a massive shame.  I saw a girl wearing the team short/underwear totally covered by her small t-shirt because the spandex were so short!  Volleyball is not swimming, and comparing uniforms to swimsuits is absurd.  Players are moving through air, not water, and inches of clothing covering the legs is not going to shape performance compared to drag created in water from additional material. \74br /\76\74br /\76If tight spandex really does facilitate their playing, let them wear longer ones that cover at least mid-thigh or a few inches above the knee.  \74br /\76\74br /\76I speculate the trend for short/tight is a product of fashion/corporate interests \46amp; the sexualization of women\46#39;s volleyball--neither of which promotes the valuable aspects of team sports.

We were upset when told that tight spandex shorts were part of the required team uniform.  Our girls were both uncomfortable with the idea of wearing the spandex shorts for a number of reasons. First they did not like how they felt when they tried them on (tight and restrictive). Second -how expossed they felt while wearing them.  And finally they felt like they were being forced to conform to a dress code that made little logical sense to them.  Even our 12 year old, who has watched both men and women play at the Olympic level noted the double standard when it comes to volleyball attire.  She pointed out that for both team (indoor) and beach volleyball, the dress codes are always more revealing for the women. Having played on many other sports teams (soccer, cross-country, basketball) this was the first and only sport that overtly promotes such a double standard. \74br /\76 Our older daughter inquired with a couple of the volleyball club coaches about the reason for women and not men to wear spandex, and the coaches could not provide an answer. One even said he had never considered it. So we talked to a third coach of the older u18 girls team.  She said in her opinion the shorts (and bikinis for beach volleyball) do not provide any competitive or preformace advantage. If so men would all be wearing spandex (or speedo\46#39;s). She felt that the spandex and bikinis objectify both girls and women, and are an outdated and unquestioned fasion trend.  She was happy to hear that our daughters were questioning the issue and using their critical thinking skills at a relatively young age.  She said she plans to address the matter with the club directer in hopes of changing the team dress code. \74br /\76We as a family are happy to see that there is a dialogue on the issue. We hope to see a time when girls and women will judged only by their performance (rather then how they look) on the court.', 'timestamp': '1342037053215', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751342037053215#c8308747933481094294', 'author': {'name': 'Anonymous', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif', 'profileUrl': ''}, 'displayTime': 'July 11, 2012 at 4:04 PM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-397401190'}, {'id': '4138238068509178629', 'parentId': '8308747933481094294', 'body': 'Thanks for adding such a thoughtful comment to the dialogue.', 'timestamp': '1342092747638', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751342092747638#c4138238068509178629', 'author': {'name': 'STATS DAD', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'https://www.blogger.com/profile/02064339642016778441'}, 'displayTime': 'July 12, 2012 at 7:32 AM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1937095180'}, {'id': '1732776224783566646', 'body': 'Pepperdine won the women\46#39;s 2012 beach volleyball championship wearing loose shorts not spandex.

My girlfriend wears clothing that is a bit tighter, but nothing that my grandma who took manners classes would not approve of. Point being: girls are told to wear skinny clothing, and if they don\46#39;t then other girls make fun of them and call them fat. Team dress may make you look better, but it should not come at the expense of outlines of more private areas very clearly showing.

I won\46#39;t go over what has been beaten to death about the pros and cons of spandex, but give some enlightenment to other coaches, or parents that want to discuss it with their coach.  Our rules are simple, if you or your child are uncomfortable with her wearing spandex, then any athletic shorts of the same color that they are comfortable with will be fine.  We don\46#39;t provide spandex as part of the uniform, each girl is responsible for her own so that they can buy the ones that fit her body type as far as length.  We also do not wear them out of the venue in club, or even off the court in school ball.  We wear black, as the lighter colors can seem more like body paint than a piece of clothing.  On the subject of length, the longer they are the more they will ride up, so something in the middle works best.  If you have your daughter wear the \46#39;soccer\46#39; shorts instead, make sure she wears spandex under them, as the soccer shorts aren\46#39;t tight enough to keep her private parts covered diving and rolling, or even sitting and stretching.

My daughter  and I had found some at Target that were longer and some moms were glad about that, but then, at a tournament, I found my daughter was told she had to wear the Nike shorts that were about 4 inches rather than the 5-6 inch ones from Target, which I didn\46#39;t know about until she was playing!

Also If you haven\46#39;t noticed, women get more of the meat on their lower body and men get more on their upper body. I think that\46#39;s a reason why women wear spandex but men don\46#39;t.

And volleyball players are ALWAYS in this position.  \74br /\76\74br /\76Why spandex for girls only? probably a lot of reasons but the biggest one for me is defense.  Girls dive/roll/hit the ground differently (and probably a lot more frequently) than men do.  It\46#39;s just the nature of the sport.  Men\46#39;s volleyball is offensively driven with big swings and short rallies.  If a player hasn\46#39;t read properly to dig a ball, he probably won\46#39;t.  Women\46#39;s volleyball tends to be scrappier with longer rallies and scramble plays.

Thank you, real life COLLEGE volleyball PLAYER for your post!!  I find it more that parents are the ones objecting to spandex, not the players (or freaks on a religious tangent).  \74br /\76\74br /\76With that said, me being a former college/high school/club coach and college vb player and now father of girls... the younger ones could be introduced to spandex that are longer. No doubt about it. I agree that there are some little ones or those that are bigger either wear them a size too small or roll them down at the waist and show butt cheeks. At the younger age, they won\46#39;t be getting on the ground as aggressive as when players get older (please see a middle school match).  But from my coaching experience, I never told what the players HAD TO wear, but all of them CHOSE to wear spandex, 100% of the time. \74br /\76\74br /\76Sexualizing?  Nah... it\46#39;s in the eye of the beholder... not the player. And for the record... I could care less what they wear. Just perform on the court.  But THE PLAYERS, those on the actual court, all chose spandex.\74br /\76\74br /\76And re: the men volleyball players.  The shorts were way shorter back in the day.  Think Magic Johnson with the Laker\46#39;s short.  Shorts just got longer over time as an acceptable fashion statement. But as stated above the two sports (men\46#39;s vs women\46#39;s volleyball) are quite different from each other. And in our American culture... I don\46#39;t think men or women want to see the men\46#39;s junk so tight and personal. \74br /\76\74br /\76So, it\46#39;s been my experience that the PLAYERS CHOOSE to wear spandex because of the explanation above.  But agree that why not make them longer for the younger ones to start to get use to the uniform that the PLAYERS agree to play with. \74br /\76\74br /\76Just my experienced 2 cents.', 'timestamp': '1416377258668', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751416377258668#c4526696327505391912', 'author': {'name': 'Anonymous', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif', 'profileUrl': ''}, 'displayTime': 'November 19, 2014 at 1:07 AM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-960020577'}, {'id': '592358270466052494', 'parentId': '9203080194913893658', 'body': 'It does not matter to me what they wear, but why can\46#39;t they wear the short shorts with spandex underwear underneath?', 'timestamp': '1418444055273', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751418444055273#c592358270466052494', 'author': {'name': 'track4127', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'https://www.blogger.com/profile/04903860382680186743'}, 'displayTime': 'December 12, 2014 at 11:14 PM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-345591132'}, {'id': '8332918382402410869', 'parentId': '1477912693255947642', 'body': 'it\46#39;s actually so that nothing moves around bc we dig and dive for the ball and if you wore loose shorts then you\46#39;ll just flash everyone watching', 'timestamp': '1421454268391', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751421454268391#c8332918382402410869', 'author': {'name': 'Anonymous', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif', 'profileUrl': ''}, 'displayTime': 'January 16, 2015 at 7:24 PM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1384985215'}, {'id': '2319922440332573267', 'parentId': '1477912693255947642', 'body': 'This is why these shorts should not be so short, I hate it, my daughter wants to be a gymnast but I cant bear to see her half naked and will not allow it, even she asked me why they wear such costumes and she is only 6.... this needs to change.', 'timestamp': '1422837564190', 'permalink': 'http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment\0751422837564190#c2319922440332573267', 'author': {'name': 'Anonymous', 'avatarUrl': 'https://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif', 'profileUrl': ''}, 'displayTime': 'February 1, 2015 at 7:39 PM', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-959437282'}, {'id': '5546373095713147685', 'parentId': '4678253842261046916', 'body': 'A happy medium is necessary.

I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and she confirmed it that she has made her decision,and she never wanted to see me again. So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my wife.So i explained every thing to her,so she told me that the only way i can get my wife back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then she gave me the email address of the spell caster whom she visited.{ayokospellcaster@gmail.com }. So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address she gave to me,and the spell caster assured me that i will get my wife back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my wife who didn\46#39;t call me for the past seven {7}months,gave me a call to inform me that she was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how she came back that same day,with lots of love and joy,and she apologized for her mistake,and for the pain she caused me and my children.

When his cousin died in a tragic car accident he went back to Philippine for a week to be with his family. I could not go because I was in the middle of entertaining out of town clients for work. He did not seem to be upset that I could not go so I let him be. The next thing that I know, he reconnected with an old friend from high school that he had a crush on years ago and they started to have an affair! I had no clue what was going on until 2 months after he came back from Philippine.He proceeded to see both her and I until I caught him testing her one night. I confronted him and he told me the truth about what happened. We broke up and went our separate ways. Neither of us fought for our relationship. I was angry and decided not to be upset about it and just keep it moving. Then after about a month of not speaking to him I became sad. I wanted him to tell me that he wanted to be with me and not her. I contacted lord aguma   for a love spell and he totally helped me! he was able to get him to miss me to where he wanted to get back together again. He had a lot of regrets and felt bad for not fighting to keep me and for cheating in general. He values our relationship so much more now and we are together now!

I know there are lots of women like me out there who have done so much to have back their Husband, I am here to tell you all to search no further because the answer is right here. I sincerely believe if there are up to five spell casters like DOCTOR CANDOVA this world would be a better place, I have seen people complaining on how fake spell castes promised to help them but couldn&#39;t but with DOCTOR CANDOVA I tell you your problem is solved already. My Husband and I had been apart for 3 YEARS  and I couldn&#39;t bear without living without him, I have tried everything to have him back but nothing was working until I saw numerous testimonies about a spell caster call DOCTOR CANDOVA and how great his work is. I contacted him via email candovalovespell@yahoo.com immediately and follow the step that he ask  and in the next 48 hours my ex lover called me and was eager for my forgiveness and that he wished nothing more than to have me in his arms forever. I filled so much joy and happiness that I found DOCTOR CANDOVA, I hope you all here will find this testimony of mine and get your husband back in just 48 hours. DOCTOR CANDOVA contact is CANDOVALOVESPELL@YAHOO.COM or you can call him on +2347030393888 you are the next to share your testimony to every one. </p><span id='bc_0_2MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1276309633'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5137068598526957742'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_2BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_2B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_0I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_0T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_3B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_6B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YwqsZ1_sp48/TaP5R4StDgI/AAAAAAAAABM/1Yh3gGfLwtA/s35/196766_209321242427985_100000503314363_809865_1353184_n.jpg'></img></div><div id='c1477912693255947642' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_6M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/14224040106815960627'>loco</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1303043534655#c1477912693255947642'>April 17, 2011 at 8:32 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_6MC' class='comment-content'>yeah.. im kinda thinking also about that when i first saw a women volleyball match!

I am a woman who played volleyball in middle school in non-spandex shorts.  The issue of tightness &amp; length are separate.  The argument that tight spandex helps performance (flexibility, out the way) seems valuable, but I see no value in the &quot;shorts&quot; that are basically the same as &quot;boys cut underwear&quot; i.e. less than 2-3&quot; inseam.  I went to a tournament of 12-14y.o. recently, and was dismayed than 98% of the girls there were wearing these underwear in place of shorts.  One team had a few girls wearing spandex there were still short, but with a 4-6&quot; inseam, which was such a relief!  <br /><br />There is a lot of room for shorts (spandex or otherwise) to cover between the crotch and the knee, and it should be used!  I saw lots of girls constantly picking their underwear/shorts from the front or back as they rode up or got sweaty &amp; uncomfortable.  I believe players should wear uniforms that are comfortable &amp; that they do not distract them--these short/underwear certainly distracted a number of girls I saw.  <br /><br />These underwear/short uniforms must discourage potential players who do not want to bend over, or even walk around half-naked, and that is a massive shame.  I saw a girl wearing the team short/underwear totally covered by her small t-shirt because the spandex were so short!  Volleyball is not swimming, and comparing uniforms to swimsuits is absurd.  Players are moving through air, not water, and inches of clothing covering the legs is not going to shape performance compared to drag created in water from additional material. <br /><br />If tight spandex really does facilitate their playing, let them wear longer ones that cover at least mid-thigh or a few inches above the knee.  <br /><br />I speculate the trend for short/tight is a product of fashion/corporate interests &amp; the sexualization of women&#39;s volleyball--neither of which promotes the valuable aspects of team sports.  Mizuno, asics, whatever brands &amp; vball associations that promote these ridiculous shorts should be called out for this absurd sexualization of women and young girls.</p><span id='bc_0_15MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1654169111'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=7941014380270782469'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_15BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_15B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_16B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c5546373095713147685' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_16M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/01867804561346716327'>Theo the Thinker</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1423631550454#c5546373095713147685'>February 11, 2015 at 12:12 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_16MC' class='comment-content'>A happy medium is necessary.

I need to purchase a few pairs for my daughter who starts club in January. :) I am a former volleyball player myself and was actually around for the turn from &quot;baggy&quot; to spandex.  I have my own personal archive of photos like the pic&#39;s above.  I just had to weigh in because 1. I was a very athletic girl, you could assume rather stocky with huge legs for jumping higher than the other girl ;)), 2. I actually have worn them before to play and 3. I am a woman, who was a girl, and as far as the comments go, it seems like only men, specifically fathers, have the negative opinions regarding female attire.  In your research Stat Dad, I am unsure why you didn&#39;t actually ask some coaches, or a national volleyball league representitive, seeing as they tend to set the standards. I attended private school, with a strict dress code, but by my senior year, we were all in spandex.  Our school won state, not because we were &quot;distracting&quot; the officials, but because we were good and the spandex, plain and simple, enable you to move without restriction.  I hate to hammer home a point, however, being a larger girl, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever heard the comment, &quot;eat your shorts&quot;??  Well, in ANY traditional (baggy) shorts, that&#39;s exactly what my thighs do...they munch the WHOLE time, incredibly embarrassing.  Even now, I am a runner and I have to wear skin tight shorts/capris/or compression pants so I don&#39;t eat my shorts all over town.  I agree with safeashouse, men and women, hate to draw attention to it, are different.  My husband does not, will not ever have to worry about shorts, or having kids.  My job, my department. ;)) Why don&#39;t female beach volleyball players wear board shorts and go topless???? Need I say more on that...my point, comparison never really works unilaterally, just ask my kiddos ;)).  Spandex stay put while playing volleyball, and running for that matter, you don&#39;t worry about tugging, twisting, billowing, munching shorts.  And trust me I did not have the body that would attract &quot;revenue&quot; in spandex, if anything they would have probably wanted to pay me to put on some sweats ;)).<br />Donald, I would hate for you to make a decision for your daughter based on the &quot;tightness&quot; of shorts.  Girls should know that sports fall in to that awesome category where how you look doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s how you play the game.  Have her go longer 4&quot;, or even 5&quot;, and tell her to keep baggy shorts/sweat pants until it&#39;s time to practice/play the game.  If she&#39;s not running around town, sashaying in front of the boys, and wanting to wear them out to dinner with the fam, than Daddy, your good to go.  But if you can&#39;t pry her out of them than....I hate to tell you, your problem is waaaaaaaay bigger than tight shorts.<br />StatsDad-Your wife made the right call, longer does not hurt your ability to dive, roll, etc. I for one, whether it is baggy shorts being eaten or spandex being eaten, do not like to see butt cheek hanging out. :)) <br /><br />Have a great one!        <br /><br />I tried to sign in and post with my name, but it said I didn&#39;t have access, go figure :)).  <br />Janell from Central Cali</p><span id='bc_0_36MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1660151717'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=2714814613647506522'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_36BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_36b+seedCn8eD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_33T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_33TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_33TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_33TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_33TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_33TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_33TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_33TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_33B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c4957755310639672928' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_33M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1330065921265#c4957755310639672928'>February 24, 2012 at 1:45 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_33MC' class='comment-content'>do you put two perentheses in your emotes because of your double chin?  why do you do that?</p><span id='bc_0_33MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-2086616722'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=4957755310639672928'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_33BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_33B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_34B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c7469793165507364742' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_34M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1344364554119#c7469793165507364742'>August 7, 2012 at 2:35 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_34MC' class='comment-content'>Awesome post!

I am an 18 year old girl who did not want to try out for volleyball because I am not comfortable with their attire. Boys wear long loose shorts for their matches some schools make boys wear long spandex. For girls, no matter what school you go to - their volleyball shorts are up to their crotch and show their underbutt half the time. I find this sexist. And even though I love volleyball, I was not comfortable with shorts being so short. I asked my friends on the team - and they&#39;re not comfortable with the length either. It does not provide them with an advantage either. </p><span id='bc_0_35MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1178259757'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=6794479408826134220'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_35BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_35B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_33I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_33T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_36B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_38B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c5453482734659991689' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_38M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user blog-author'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/02064339642016778441'>STATS DAD</a></cite><span class='icon user blog-author'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1323887096509#c5453482734659991689'>December 14, 2011 at 1:24 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_38MC' class='comment-content'>Janell - thanks for your comment based on experience.

I asked why do they have to be so short and I was told it was because of the company they were buying them from. My daughter  and I had found some at Target that were longer and some moms were glad about that, but then, at a tournament, I found my daughter was told she had to wear the Nike shorts that were about 4 inches rather than the 5-6 inch ones from Target, which I didn&#39;t know about until she was playing! (thanks, coach, for letting me know this change in attire- which we HAD discussed, and it was OK for MY daughter to wear longer ones because of OUR modesty policy in our family! Guess she had to match everyone else- talk about peer pressure--looks like the coaches and managers of teams need to address this, but they won&#39;t)  I have accepted the tight wear because  of them jumping and moving- loose shorts would be too apt to show undergarments. BUT! I wish the girls would realize  it looks ridiculous to be tugging those 2 inch-4 inch ones down when you have a larger rear!! I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve witnessed that! I think they need to wear them longer.<br />Also, some girls don&#39;t get the right size, so it makes it worse. I think it&#39;s distracting, and I also believe in &quot;protecting the eyes&quot; of males at the games.<br /> When our boys did track, they would wear  a spandex UNDER loose shorts. That was a team thing, and I think the girls were the same. Thanks for saying something- this has bugged me for years, and I always swore my daughter wouldn&#39;t play the sport, but, low and behold , this is what she&#39;s good at! </p><span id='bc_0_37MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1234141232'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=3173461206327921441'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_37BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_37B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_37I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_37T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_38B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_41B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c8934521757489236006' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_41M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1324156026972#c8934521757489236006'>December 17, 2011 at 4:07 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_41MC' class='comment-content'>I think if you did the research you would also find that many men&#39;s basketball and volleyball players wear similar styled shorts underneath the uniform shorts for many of the same reasons.  Women just seem to be more comfortable or resigned to the fact that these are the outerwear shorts whereas the men wear them as underwear.  Just do a search for compression shorts and you&#39;ll get the idea.  Also keep in mind a guy wearing shorts that tight would reveal a whole lot more than women wearing shorts that tight.  Swimmers have to do it because it provides a measured statistical advantage plus you are in the water for the vast majority of the event so no one sees much for very long.  In things like basketball/volleyball you are out there for all to see.</p><span id='bc_0_41MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1950548774'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=8934521757489236006'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_41BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_41b+seedCn9XD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_39T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_39TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_39TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_39TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_39TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_39TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_39TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_39TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_39B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c5776717286566855529' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_39M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1408166961770#c5776717286566855529'>August 16, 2014 at 1:29 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_39MC' class='comment-content'>Okay I understand what you&#39;re saying about males entire crotch showing if they wear tight pants.

Several girls I&#39;ve coached have said that they find the tight shorts more comfortable that longer shorts.  These were not fashion-conscious girls. Second, several of the bigger girls preferred to wear loose shorts. Our solution was to have a flexible uniform, so people could choose the style they preferred. <br />2. As a guy, I prefer wearing shorter shorts to the basketball-style popular in the US - I find they get sweaty and tangled. This is a preference across Europe, few male volleyballers wear the basketball style.<br />3. Some of the switch you noticed may have come from regulation - the FIVB back in the 80s (I think) mandated leotard style uniforms for women&#39;s teams. This died a death (thankfully) after a few years, however they have introduced a maximum width of material over the hip for beach vb.  It&#39;s a stupid idea imho, since most girls would have worn bikinis anyway, and it puts some girls off playing.</p><span id='bc_0_49MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-494616478'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=6632554612418498737'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_49BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_49B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_50B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c2236906403967163765' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_50M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user blog-author'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/02064339642016778441'>STATS DAD</a></cite><span class='icon user blog-author'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1327531146633#c2236906403967163765'>January 25, 2012 at 5:39 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_50MC' class='comment-content'>Thanks for adding to the conversation and adding your WE / UK perspective.</p><span id='bc_0_50MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1937095180'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=2236906403967163765'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_50BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_50B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_51B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c8747876932374649282' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_51M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/12130537328407337929'>Tim Chappell</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1327559466746#c8747876932374649282'>January 26, 2012 at 1:31 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_51MC' class='comment-content'>I&#39;m a journalist doing an enterprise piece on why women&#39;s volleyball shorts are so tight.

I have played volleyball on co-ed teams since I was in 4th grade. I have been wearing spandex (tight) shorts since the middle of 4th grade . I can tell you that it made a big difference. I play libero (back middle)and it is was easier to dive and roll without having to worry about my shorts coming up like they would with baggy shorts. many girls on my tesm want to wear the short I do because it is difficult to play with baggie shorts but like some of you their parents will not let them. You can actually see the difference it makes tough. There are all different lengths of shorts too. It&#39;s not like your daughters are going to be wearing the shorter-than-bikini-olimpic shorts. Now THOSE are short. <br />Some of you say that we just wear these to atract boys but truthfuly we get about four teenaged boys that come to our ganes. One is a brother to one of the players and the other three are players from our other team. (we have two volleyball teams) <br />I love clothes but wearing these shorts is not just another one of my fashion statements.I love then because of comfort and flexiblity.I want you to know that actually it was my parent (mom AND dad) who first introduced me to spandex shorts. Yeh i know shocking.<br />And dads out there....Please Please,PLEASE dont make wearing spandex permit your daughters from playing volleyball!!! It is an amazing sport and i know that they will love playing it as much as I do!!!</p><span id='bc_0_53MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1546390122'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=1027823773660872984'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_53BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_53B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_55B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c191124912571724128' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_55M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1329611252880#c191124912571724128'>February 18, 2012 at 7:27 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_55MC' class='comment-content'>I am a female, college student at a very popular division I school and I can honestly say it seems as though the spandex shorts worn in volleyball certainly are a means of sex appeal.  Many boys have the women&#39;s volleyball poster hanging in their dorm rooms and will often bring up how &#39;hot&#39; the women are.  Do they ever mention how talented or hard-working they are? No. From what I&#39;ve collected, the transition from baggier shorts to the spandex ones was a method of attracting more fans to an unpopular through sex appeal. Personally, I feel this is not an appropriate way to get people to notice the sport or attend games.  I&#39;d rather be known for my talent than my body. Although I do say to all of the fathers out there who are not allowing their daughters to play because of this attire, consider changing your mind. If they love the sport, let them play and feel confident while doing so!<br /><br />-I.P.</p><span id='bc_0_55MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1307044962'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=191124912571724128'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_55BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_55b+seedCn8dD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_54T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_54TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_54TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_54TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_54TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_54TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_54TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_54TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_54B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c3531269473324966793' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_54M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user blog-author'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/02064339642016778441'>STATS DAD</a></cite><span class='icon user blog-author'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1329654593871#c3531269473324966793'>February 19, 2012 at 7:29 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_54MC' class='comment-content'>I was wondering if this was the reason - I could not find evidence of this and I was surprised that it too almost 30 comments for someone to suggest it.

I weigh 140 pounds, and honestly, am NOT the thinnest girl in the world. You would think shorts like that make me uncomfortable. But when i&#39;m on the court, playing the sport i love, i forget about what i&#39;m wearing and just play the game. I would encourage ALL girls interested in the sport, whether you&#39;re my size, smaller, or bigger. If you love the game, the uniform shouldn&#39;t matter. And to any parent that is considering not letting their daughter play because of the shorts, please, PLEASE reconsider. Volleyball is such a remarkable sport that has become a huge part of my life and has taught me countless lessons.

Never knew the controversy until I was biking to class at the UW one day and found the campus literally swarming with beautiful girls of all ages--middle school to collegiate--  in this &#39;notorious&#39; attire. I love girl watching and was earlier disappointed when the soccer shorts got long and baggy recently on the girls all of a sudden this season. Then, THIS! <br />  Have to admit that the answer is obvious--its about the sex, I don&#39;t mind, its the only reason I&#39;ll go to games now. Even football is a bore without high-hemmed cheerleaders. I&#39;m just surprised that the PC Establishment which pretends to be so &#39;feminist&#39; even allowed this uniform --but I&#39;m NOT complaining.<br />  A beautiful girl(s) is a more inspiring sight than what&#39;s on the scoreboard.<br />  I&#39;m not a parent, don&#39;t expect to be for the foreseeable future, and perhaps I&#39;d feel differently if I was a parent of fresh young things....</p><span id='bc_0_63MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1300294594'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5031275352863185348'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_63BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_63B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_64B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c2036211209516841504' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_64M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1339796970808#c2036211209516841504'>June 15, 2012 at 5:49 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_64MC' class='comment-content'>god create the beautiful garden of eden and everything therin was just as perfect  soon he created woman and he is in trouble since men you continue to dress good women are a disgraced</p><span id='bc_0_64MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1203947981'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=2036211209516841504'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_64BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_64B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_65B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c2671454917241836915' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_65M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1341697527487#c2671454917241836915'>July 7, 2012 at 5:45 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_65MC' class='comment-content'>The problem with all the womens answers is there all brain washed by our society to wear that any way.

We were upset when told that tight spandex shorts were part of the required team uniform.  Our girls were both uncomfortable with the idea of wearing the spandex shorts for a number of reasons. First they did not like how they felt when they tried them on (tight and restrictive). Second -how expossed they felt while wearing them.  And finally they felt like they were being forced to conform to a dress code that made little logical sense to them.  Even our 12 year old, who has watched both men and women play at the Olympic level noted the double standard when it comes to volleyball attire.  She pointed out that for both team (indoor) and beach volleyball, the dress codes are always more revealing for the women. Having played on many other sports teams (soccer, cross-country, basketball) this was the first and only sport that overtly promotes such a double standard. <br /> Our older daughter inquired with a couple of the volleyball club coaches about the reason for women and not men to wear spandex, and the coaches could not provide an answer. One even said he had never considered it. So we talked to a third coach of the older u18 girls team.  She said in her opinion the shorts (and bikinis for beach volleyball) do not provide any competitive or preformace advantage. If so men would all be wearing spandex (or speedo&#39;s). She felt that the spandex and bikinis objectify both girls and women, and are an outdated and unquestioned fasion trend.  She was happy to hear that our daughters were questioning the issue and using their critical thinking skills at a relatively young age.  She said she plans to address the matter with the club directer in hopes of changing the team dress code. <br />We as a family are happy to see that there is a dialogue on the issue. We hope to see a time when girls and women will judged only by their performance (rather then how they look) on the court.</p><span id='bc_0_68MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-397401190'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=8308747933481094294'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_68BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_68b+seedCn8uD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_67T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_67TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_67TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_67TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_67TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_67TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_67TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_67TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_67B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c4138238068509178629' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_67M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user blog-author'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/02064339642016778441'>STATS DAD</a></cite><span class='icon user blog-author'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1342092747638#c4138238068509178629'>July 12, 2012 at 7:32 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_67MC' class='comment-content'>Thanks for adding such a thoughtful comment to the dialogue.</p><span id='bc_0_67MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1937095180'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=4138238068509178629'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_67BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_67B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_67I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_67T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_68B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_70B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c1732776224783566646' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_70M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1342749515937#c1732776224783566646'>July 19, 2012 at 9:58 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_70MC' class='comment-content'>Pepperdine won the women&#39;s 2012 beach volleyball championship wearing loose shorts not spandex.

Possibly because our society embraces low standards and less modesty.  One girl made an argument that in other sports many athletes were spandex under their shorts.  That really just proved this dads point.  Why not just do that?  The reason?  Because it is all about appearance and popularity of the sport. Its no reason to keep daughters from playing sports....but covering up the obvious by saying it benefits the players is just laughable.</p><span id='bc_0_72MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-227674772'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=6670907165225595952'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_72BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_72b+seedCn9_D' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_71T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_71TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_71TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_71TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_71TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_71TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_71TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_71TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_71B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c5862745232917913044' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_71M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/07335312125260303355'>volleyball mom</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1438387022751#c5862745232917913044'>July 31, 2015 at 7:57 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_71MC' class='comment-content'>You are ridiculous.  It IS more comfortable to play in spandex than anything else.  No wedgies, they don&#39;t ride up if you find the right fit/style for your body type.<br />Doing shoulder rolls could become embarrassing if you don&#39;t have spandex on.  You ask why not wear shorts over it?  WHY wear shorts over it? WHY add another layer that can get out of place and add more heat retention? <br /><br /> Oh wait, because women, especially athletes, should allow what runs through men&#39;s minds to dictate every one of their clothing and uniform choices.   Seems its mostly men who have problems with the volleyball uniform, because they cant understand why a woman or girl would choose to wear something unless it&#39;s to impress a man or sexualize themselves.  It couldn&#39;t possibly be because they WANT to, could it.  Nope, it&#39;s always all about men and sex appeal.</p><span id='bc_0_71MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1702334248'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5862745232917913044'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_71BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_71B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_71I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_71T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_72B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_74B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c3302637229569105996' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_74M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1343955532324#c3302637229569105996'>August 2, 2012 at 8:58 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_74MC' class='comment-content'>It&#39;s just about fashion. Male basketball players used to wear some short shorts a couple of decades ago, but now knee-length shorts are the thing. Current fashion trends point males to wear baggy clothing and women to wear tight-fitting clothing. I know that I personally like for my daily wear to be somewhat loose, but baggy, just comfortable. My girlfriend wears clothing that is a bit tighter, but nothing that my grandma who took manners classes would not approve of. Point being: girls are told to wear skinny clothing, and if they don&#39;t then other girls make fun of them and call them fat. Team dress may make you look better, but it should not come at the expense of outlines of more private areas very clearly showing. I honestly don&#39;t see why athletic shorts aren&#39;t an acceptable substitute. I mean, female basketball players are far from being inappropriately dressed. The &quot;competitive edge&quot; of these spandex shorts is bogus. No net judge is going to call you for clothing touching, and gym shorts are NOT restrictive. I could do the splits in my knee-lengths if I was physically capable, lol.</p><span id='bc_0_74MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-182009085'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=3302637229569105996'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_74BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_74b+seedCn81D' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_73T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_73TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_73TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_73TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_73TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_73TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_73TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_73TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_73B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c4025540873637006536' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_73M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1343955585139#c4025540873637006536'>August 2, 2012 at 8:59 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_73MC' class='comment-content'>not* baggy</p><span id='bc_0_73MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-182009085'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=4025540873637006536'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_73BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_73B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_73I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_73T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_74B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_76B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c3105594203759636745' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_76M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1344118553397#c3105594203759636745'>August 4, 2012 at 6:15 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_76MC' class='comment-content'>I coach volleyball, so I&#39;ve had this discussion many times.  I won&#39;t go over what has been beaten to death about the pros and cons of spandex, but give some enlightenment to other coaches, or parents that want to discuss it with their coach.  Our rules are simple, if you or your child are uncomfortable with her wearing spandex, then any athletic shorts of the same color that they are comfortable with will be fine.  We don&#39;t provide spandex as part of the uniform, each girl is responsible for her own so that they can buy the ones that fit her body type as far as length.  We also do not wear them out of the venue in club, or even off the court in school ball.  We wear black, as the lighter colors can seem more like body paint than a piece of clothing.  On the subject of length, the longer they are the more they will ride up, so something in the middle works best.  If you have your daughter wear the &#39;soccer&#39; shorts instead, make sure she wears spandex under them, as the soccer shorts aren&#39;t tight enough to keep her private parts covered diving and rolling, or even sitting and stretching.  Hope this helps.</p><span id='bc_0_76MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin

I mean they might as well be underwear which brings me to the argument a friend&#39;s daughter in high school said when I asked her why she pulls her shorts up: &quot;What, on the beach they&#39;re in bikinis!&quot;<br /><br />Final answer - girls like it, they like to show off and like the way it looks when they do.  <br /><br />As a mother, I don&#39;t like it but she kinda has a point, they DO wear bikinis on the beach so the inside shorts aren&#39;t that short in retrospect.</p><span id='bc_0_84MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1289911434'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=6513500471173316651'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_84BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_84b+seedCn-AD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_83T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_83TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_83TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_83TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_83TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_83TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_83TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_83TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_83B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c4766067936761503215' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_83M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/07335312125260303355'>volleyball mom</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1438387339786#c4766067936761503215'>July 31, 2015 at 8:02 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_83MC' class='comment-content'>FINAL ANSWER - They pull them UP as they get older because their thighs get bigger and it helps them stay put better.

Its an amazing sport! I only played for 3-4 years but it was amazing, really gives you some self esteem and strength.<br />I was a curvy girl myself and maybe the shorts didn&#39;t look too good on me but i wore them anyway because no one (should) care about what we look like when doing sports.

If you can&#39;t see that you&#39;re seriously in denial.<br /><br />P.S. b-b-but they can move better!!! Again, men don&#39;t use them and VB is also extremely competitive for them so any advantage will be exploited.</p><span id='bc_0_95MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1770757637'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5471642789142970086'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_95BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_95B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_96B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c8802195538515322323' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_96M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1402614866835#c8802195538515322323'>June 12, 2014 at 7:14 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_96MC' class='comment-content'>I am looking into this myself as my daughter is starting middle school this fall. She said she didn&#39;t want to play volleyball. Why? I asked. She replied the same, she didn&#39;t want to play volleyball. Why? same answer. Finally I dragged the answer out of her. She doesn&#39;t want to play volleyball because she doesn&#39;t want to dress like that in public. My husband knows of two other families who have girls who won&#39;t/can&#39;t play for the same reason. It&#39;s not right! <br /><br />We raise our daughters to dress modestly and then they go to school and are forced to dress like skanks or they can&#39;t play on the volleyball team.<br />I&#39;m waiting to make my phone calls until I have a recorder so I can remember what they say correctly. I&#39;ll be seeing a lawyer on Tuesday at a free clinic asking their advice. If I run into any trouble with my daughter not being able to dress modestly in order to be on the team, I will be getting a lawyer and sue for religious discrimination. Hopefully it won&#39;t go that far.<br /><br />I saw only a few minutes of a home volleyball game once when I went to pickup my son at the high school. It was gross! There was more than one girl with butt cheeks sticking out. Many of the girls were tugging at the back of their shorts to pull them down. I thought they were supposed to have their hands ready to play?<br /><br />As mature adults we are supposed to protect our children. Wearing a uniform for volleyball that consists of nothing but black underwear is not appropriate attire for middle school and high school girls volleyball. It is NOT necessary for proper performance of the game.<br /><br />I&#39;ve already contacted our state sports organization and they said there is no rule that states that all shorts need to be the same length.<br />It&#39;s all about peer pressure and wanting to look cool because it&#39;s the IN thing to wear. I was raised to stand up against peer pressure, to be my own person.<br /><br />After reading the above comments she may wear some long spandex UNDER her loose, longer shorts to keep covered should they rise up. <br />Another thought, why would girls who think nothing of wearing sexy short spandex care if loose shorts rise up and show off their legs? Gravity should naturally make the shorts fall back into place where they belong. No pulling down required.<br /><br />Other parents may wish to just not have their daughter be able to play volleyball, but not me. It&#39;s time for someone to stand up and be counted.<br />Stop the insanity!</p><span id='bc_0_96MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-8595044'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=8802195538515322323'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_96BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_96B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_97B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c5774616146858013105' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_97M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1402733444182#c5774616146858013105'>June 14, 2014 at 4:10 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_97MC' class='comment-content'>I&#39;m a 19 year old guy, just being honest here. I&#39;ve heard it over and over again, even from my sister who is playing in college now, that the only real reason for the spandex is to bring in males. I&#39;m sure that that is not consciously many teams decision for dressing this way, but, It definitely works! When I sit with the guys at school, the first thing that the eyes go to and the first thing that&#39;s talked about is the girls asses. I really do feel that it is unnecessary. The points made in defense of the spandex are pretty weak. Even IF there was some very small advantage to them, at this young of an age is that really worth throwing out all modesty? Plain and simple, its sexy, distracting, and a major stumbling block for the guys in the gym. Someone in an earlier comment mentioned that its all about how girls have been brainwashed into thinking they have to dress this way. I think that he really hit it dead on there. I think the girls really do like the attention, not all of them, but a good many. The ones that don&#39;t like it, usually can&#39;t stand up to the peer pressure. Its really just trashy, and girls make an object out of themselves to the men around them in doing so. They will deny it, get angry about it, demand their right to do it, but in the end it is just a choice to be in on the latest fashion, to fit in,  to not stick out, or draw attention to ones self.</p><span id='bc_0_97MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1531379900'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5774616146858013105'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_97BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_97B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_98B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c3674427772307384166' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_98M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1403517762030#c3674427772307384166'>June 23, 2014 at 6:02 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_98MC' class='comment-content'>Frankly, the author of this tripe as well as the other men responding with neanderthal glee, thinks way too much about girls and women and what they wear.

I can&#39;t believe some of you are arguing that when it&#39;s sports, suddently looks don&#39;t matter. Yeah right, all the fans check their hormones at the door, and NONE of the girls EVER enjoy that kind of attention anyway. They are serious athletes.... Get real. I am a mom; I played volleyball; there is absolutely no advantage to wearing spandex underwear. NONE. These things are tiny. My kids have real underwear that provide more coverage than these things. Volleyball has gained a reputation as a &quot;sexy&quot; sport, mostly thanks to beach volleyball. Google beach volleyball, and try to argue with me. I (not my husband) do NOT want my daughters to play sports in their underwear, especially when it is completely unnecessary. I DO know what some of the male audience (and lesbians and bi&#39;s) happen to come to the games for. Wake up. I am not asking for birkas here. But self-respecting serious sport clothing that says &quot;I don&#39;t play a sport to perform as other people&#39;s sexual entertainment&quot; would be nice. A lot of people pretend life is a lot more innocent just so they can get away with what they want to get away with (wink, wink).   <br /><br />And yes, I have heard of more than a couple of girls who decided they would never play volleyball because they were too embarrassed to wear the uniforms.  </p><span id='bc_0_101MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-383761450'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=374725223371422032'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_101BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_101b+seedCn9aD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_99T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_99TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_99TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_99TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_99TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_99TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_99TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_99TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_99B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c5218355563050156332' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_99M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1409245219796#c5218355563050156332'>August 28, 2014 at 1:00 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_99MC' class='comment-content'>THank God I am not alone in using the words &quot;decency&quot;  &quot;modesty&quot; in my vocabulary.<br />Materialistic lust sells - Wake up parents!  dont hide your head in the sand ! nudity for the sake of sports is no excuse !! . </p><span id='bc_0_99MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-498127519'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5218355563050156332'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_99BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_99B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_100B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-t4KPIRa-yes/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAa98/C1y4y2EyMWo/s35-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c7203834583561185006' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_100M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/01761868181484959111'>John Osborne</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1435601597954#c7203834583561185006'>June 29, 2015 at 2:13 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_100MC' class='comment-content'>Exactly!

If you consider this though. It&#39;s only deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; in your eyes because YOU think it&#39;s sexual. Honestly from experience I can tell you that down to knee spandex is highly uncomfortable. Leggings would work but that gets extremely hot and sweaty. It honestly only seems sexual because you make it to be. So maybe you should stop sexualizing women who are just trying to play a sport. <br />Shorts are super annoying for some women because women have hips. So women will have a curve. Shorts go up that figure curve and eventually the shorts are all the way up to their stomach and it&#39;s highly uncomfortable. And I&#39;ll also point out that girls are more likely to get a big butt in comparison to guys. I know of a girl who can only wear leggings and spandex because loose baggy shorts don&#39;t fit on her due to all the muscle built on her legs and butt. She once tried to wear the shorts that the male volleyball team wore because there was a shorts theme that day, but she couldn&#39;t fit. Shorts just don&#39;t stretch the way spandex do. Also If you haven&#39;t noticed, women get more of the meat on their lower body and men get more on their upper body. I think that&#39;s a reason why women wear spandex but men don&#39;t. </p><span id='bc_0_103MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-787575930'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=5823769843909276288'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_103BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_103B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_104B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c5412429240586631522' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_104M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1407810236959#c5412429240586631522'>August 11, 2014 at 10:23 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_104MC' class='comment-content'>I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m taking time to comment, but I am.

We went from a fully covered Mary mother of Jesus (ever heard of the word modesty ?) to having our daughters become naked for the sake of sports and aerodynamics.  I was not aware of this issue. So I goggled girls volleyball , to my schock i ended up in  a;porn site that showed a 10 minute video of girls playing volleyball (why would this be in a porn site???!!!)  To my then further shock the video was showing lots of close up shots on the groin area of the girls.  Are we naive parents ?  stupid ? or is our head in the sand ?  The close up shots showed very clearly the size and shape of the anus and vulva - nothing left for the imagination.  SO the real question is why do we let our daughters wear such short and tight shorts that their private parts are clearly seen ?

I swear!  Think about it this way, when you are wearing basketball shorts or even running shorts at the gym, your shorts feel restrictive when you attempt to do any sort of squat.  And volleyball players are ALWAYS in this position.  <br /><br />Why spandex for girls only? probably a lot of reasons but the biggest one for me is defense.  Girls dive/roll/hit the ground differently (and probably a lot more frequently) than men do.  It&#39;s just the nature of the sport.  Men&#39;s volleyball is offensively driven with big swings and short rallies.  If a player hasn&#39;t read properly to dig a ball, he probably won&#39;t.  Women&#39;s volleyball tends to be scrappier with longer rallies and scramble plays.  I know from experience that baggy shorts get tangled up when diving and feel restrictive when you are in an athletic volleyball stance.</p><span id='bc_0_110MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-963122228'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=9203080194913893658'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_110BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_110b+seedCn9fD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_108T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_108TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_108TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_108TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_108TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_108TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_108TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_108TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_108B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c4526696327505391912' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_108M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1416377258668#c4526696327505391912'>November 19, 2014 at 1:07 AM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_108MC' class='comment-content'>Hello!  Thank you, real life COLLEGE volleyball PLAYER for your post!!  I find it more that parents are the ones objecting to spandex, not the players (or freaks on a religious tangent).  <br /><br />With that said, me being a former college/high school/club coach and college vb player and now father of girls... the younger ones could be introduced to spandex that are longer. No doubt about it. I agree that there are some little ones or those that are bigger either wear them a size too small or roll them down at the waist and show butt cheeks. At the younger age, they won&#39;t be getting on the ground as aggressive as when players get older (please see a middle school match).  But from my coaching experience, I never told what the players HAD TO wear, but all of them CHOSE to wear spandex, 100% of the time. <br /><br />Sexualizing?  Nah... it&#39;s in the eye of the beholder... not the player. And for the record... I could care less what they wear. Just perform on the court.  But THE PLAYERS, those on the actual court, all chose spandex.<br /><br />And re: the men volleyball players.  The shorts were way shorter back in the day.  Think Magic Johnson with the Laker&#39;s short.  Shorts just got longer over time as an acceptable fashion statement. But as stated above the two sports (men&#39;s vs women&#39;s volleyball) are quite different from each other. And in our American culture... I don&#39;t think men or women want to see the men&#39;s junk so tight and personal. <br /><br />So, it&#39;s been my experience that the PLAYERS CHOOSE to wear spandex because of the explanation above.  But agree that why not make them longer for the younger ones to start to get use to the uniform that the PLAYERS agree to play with. <br /><br />Just my experienced 2 cents.</p><span id='bc_0_108MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-960020577'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=4526696327505391912'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_108BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_108B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_109B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c592358270466052494' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_109M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/04903860382680186743'>track4127</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1418444055273#c592358270466052494'>December 12, 2014 at 11:14 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_109MC' class='comment-content'>It does not matter to me what they wear, but why can&#39;t they wear the short shorts with spandex underwear underneath?</p><span id='bc_0_109MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-345591132'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=592358270466052494'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_109BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_109B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_108I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_108T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_110B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_111B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c6698666321421590968' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_111M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'>Anonymous</cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1415835261282#c6698666321421590968'>November 12, 2014 at 6:34 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_111MC' class='comment-content'>The short shorts show off a lot of skin so the average american male will watch this lame sport</p><span id='bc_0_111MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-637086072'><a o='d' target='_self' href='https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=4831859586407532872&amp;postID=6698666321421590968'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_111BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_111B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_112B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/anon36.png'></img></div><div id='c395264838745268126' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_112M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.similarto.us/nike.com/'>similarto</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.statsdad.com/2011/01/youth-volleyball-why-are-girls.html?showComment=1425326487723#c395264838745268126'>March 2, 2015 at 3:01 PM</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_112MC' class='comment-content'>I like 2007 attire the best. 1991 is worst of lot.

I explained my problem to someone online and she suggested that I should contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that don&#39;t believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I meant a spell caster called Dr, erigo and I email him, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened, that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him, that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem and who is different from all the fake ones out there. Anybody could need the help of the spell caster, his email: (erigospellcaster@gmail.com) you can email him if you need his assistance in your relationship or anything.

I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and she confirmed it that she has made her decision,and she never wanted to see me again. So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my wife.So i explained every thing to her,so she told me that the only way i can get my wife back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then she gave me the email address of the spell caster whom she visited.{ayokospellcaster@gmail.com }. So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address she gave to me,and the spell caster assured me that i will get my wife back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my wife who didn&#39;t call me for the past seven {7}months,gave me a call to inform me that she was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how she came back that same day,with lots of love and joy,and she apologized for her mistake,and for the pain she caused me and my children.

When his cousin died in a tragic car accident he went back to Philippine for a week to be with his family. I could not go because I was in the middle of entertaining out of town clients for work. He did not seem to be upset that I could not go so I let him be. The next thing that I know, he reconnected with an old friend from high school that he had a crush on years ago and they started to have an affair! I had no clue what was going on until 2 months after he came back from Philippine.He proceeded to see both her and I until I caught him testing her one night. I confronted him and he told me the truth about what happened. We broke up and went our separate ways. Neither of us fought for our relationship. I was angry and decided not to be upset about it and just keep it moving. Then after about a month of not speaking to him I became sad. I wanted him to tell me that he wanted to be with me and not her. I contacted lord aguma   for a love spell and he totally helped me! he was able to get him to miss me to where he wanted to get back together again. He had a lot of regrets and felt bad for not fighting to keep me and for cheating in general. He values our relationship so much more now and we are together now!

For the past five years, I have played volleyball in basketball shorts and have done fine. I got to high school and they require spandex that are like 3&quot; max. In middle school, we practiced with the freshman team because I was on the A team, or highest team. The two best kids on my team, were me and another girl that were tied for first chair, or captain. Both of us played in basketball shorts, and were moved up to the JV team practice. The first time we got there, we were required to wear spandex, so she and I left again. We didn&#39;t want to wear shorts that made the game so much harder to play.

call the next thing i could hear was my loves voice he was pleading and begging me on the phone that i should forgive him that i should forget all that have happened that he did not know what came over him,he promised not to leave for any reason, that he was really sorry for what he did,i was so surprised because i never believed that this could happen,so that was how i accepted his apology and the next morning he came to my house and still pleading for me to forgive, him i told him that everything is okay that i have forgiven him, that was how we started again and now we are married, i promised to say this testimony in radio station, commenting this testimony is still okay but before this month runs out i promise to say this in radio station and i will,sir thank you very much.World

started acting up the love was no longer there he just changed of no reason,But thanks to Dr Kabaka who came to my rescue who i got to know when reading a magazine and where i saw great reviews about him ,So i contacted him for help and he told me my lover has been blind folded with evil spell and he told me what to do which i did and believe me my lover ken came back to me and does people who where behind it also came asking for forgiveness i had to forgive them because the man i love Ken has come back to my arms all thanks and appreciation goes to Dr Kabaka and you can contact Dr Kabaka
