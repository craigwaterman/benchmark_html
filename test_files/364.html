<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="color:gray"><i><span style="font-size:140%">I was born a poor. That's wrong I was remembering The Jerk with Steve Martin for a minute there. In truth I was born, I was raised, but never knew myself. In the 45 years I have been on this marble we call earth, I would have to say about 24 of them has been spent traveling and searching. My parents did the best they could to make sure I had all my needs met. Father was a construction worker and mom was a R.N. My dad taught me work ethic and mom taught me to think and find answers to questions.<br />
<br />
I guess it all started just after graduating high school. Most of my friends were off to college. Me I chose the military. It was a good fit and the education benefits would come in handy. After about 6 yrs I left the military and started going to school. This was something of a shock. After 6 years of a very structured living, here I was in a very open and some what disjointed situation. One thing the military does not do well is prepare you for transitioning back into civilian life.<br />
<br />
Around half way through my first year I started to relax but also keep myself focused on my studies. That's when she came into my life. A quiet and radiant woman from Tibet. Dalha was a major point of focus and distraction for me. She was the only person in my life who could calm the restlessness in me. As our relationship grew and she started to confide in me about her family and home. Her village and gathered money for 7 years to send her to an American school with her dreams of becoming a doctor so she could return to her village and care for them.<br />
<br />
During our 3rd year together (Nov of 1997) I got a called that Dalha was involved in a bus accident and was in the ICU. Needless to say I dropped what I was doing and spent the next 4 months at her side. Hoping and praying for her to wake up. On February 23 1998 she awoke for 2 days. During that time she told me that she knew she was dying and asked me to bring her home when the time came. I railed at this, how can she think she wouldn't make it. On February 26th she left my life and eased her pain. <br />
<br />
A good friend of mine who works for the United States State Dept. Rushed my passport and visa applications through in a few days as well as help me with human remains transport. On April 5th I landed at Tribhuvan International Airport in Nepal and started my journey to Tibet. Crossing the Nepalese border into China controlled Tibet at that time was an experience to say the least, much less transporting human remains. After about 5 days of paperwork and close scrutiny by Chinese officials I was allowed to enter. <br />
<br />
The next leg was more physically demanding, her village which had no name that I was ever told but is near Hemis Ladakh. I had to have everything carried by sherpas. When I finally arrived at her village the translator told me that the village elder demand that I carry her body myself to her place of rest. With her family following close behind me and the rest of her village behind them I carried the woman who I loved up 1500 feet of steep switchback paths to a plateau overlooking the valley. This place as I was told was where she would read and learn to speak English from a missionary. <br />
<br />
I sat with her again for another 3 days while family from other villages came to pay their respects. The villagers set up a tent and brought me food and water for those days. On the morning of the 4th day a monk arrived and was preforming her burial rights. That's when I completely lost it. My grief was so intense that I could not stop crying and my heart was the heaviest it has ever been. About 2 hrs after the ceremony was finished, which was one of the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed. The monk came to my tent, he sat there for hours watching me, never speaking. At dusk just before the sun set behind the mountain, he spoke, and in the most eloquent english I have heard up to that point asked me to go outside and get a pebble. <br />
<br />
I was confused and must have had the most ridiculous look on my face. Here I was at the lowest point in my life and he wants me to get a pebble. I looked at my translator and ask “he can't be serious can he?”. Well the translator got up and walked out leaving the monk and I alone. <br />
<br />
“A pebble please” he asked again. So I obliged him, returning with a pebble a little larger than an almond, he then reached over took the pebble and yanked off my left shoe. As I reach for my shoe he swatted my hand away. He then dropped the pebble in the shoe and told me to put it on and walk with him. Thinking that this was some kind of tradition, I put the shoe on and followed him. Now after about 100 yards the pebble was really starting to hurt and annoy me. But I kept going and finally making it back to the village I was in extreme pain and could feel blood flowing in my shoe. I finally dropped on my ass and ripped the shoe off and pulled the pebble out of my foot. That's when he looked at me and smiled asking me “what took you so long”. Now I was more confused than anything else. He explained to me that the pebble was my grief. It will always be a pebble and will always be here, but learning to take the pain out of my grief and learning to live with it is what will help me to understand Dalha in a way that I would never have been it. I still have that pebble, I carry it in my pocket as well as a lock of Dalha's hair. Thus began my first of 4 yrs living in Tibet.</span></i></span></div></div>

 <div class="textcontent botmarg10px blogContent"><div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>India is among the most mysterious countries in the world. Its rich mythology, vast size, and many cultural peculiarities make it fertile ground for many strange tales and legends. Some of them are clearly fabricated, others just strange enough that they just might be true, and others still are so strange that they could change our entire perception of the world.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">10. The Village Of Twins</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/119668503.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>The distant village of Kodinhi, Kerala has a secret. Not a particularly hidden secret, mind you—it’s actually pretty hard to miss. The village’s claim to fame is the abnormal amount of twins born there. Kodinhi only has around 2,000 families, yet there are 250 sets of twins officially registered there. In fact, there could be many more—experts estimate there could be as many as 350 sets of twins in the area.<br />
<br />
It gets stranger. It is estimated that the number of twins born in the village is increasing every year, and no one really knows why. This is all the more remarkable because twins are especially rare in India—on average, four out of every 1,000 Indian births are twins. In Kodinhi, the number is 45 per 1,000 births. Doctors have absolutely no idea what is causing this strange phenomenon. They assume there must be some unknown hereditary factor at work, or maybe it’s something they eat. Until they find out for sure, the Village of Twins remains one of the strangest curiosities of perhaps the most mysterious country in the world.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">9. The Jodhpur Boom</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/454378371.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>On December 18, 2012, a sudden, deafening boom startled the people of Jodhpur. It seemed to come out of nowhere, crashing in the sky like the sonic boom caused by an airplane breaking the speed of sound. However, it was more aggressive in nature, sounding a lot like a massive explosion. The citizens were concerned about the sound and asked around about it, but it soon turned out that no planes had been flying over the area and no explosions had taken place. The source of the “Jodhpur boom” was a complete mystery.<br />
<br />
The weirdest part is that it appears that the entire month was littered with strange, unexplained booms all over the world, from United Kingdom to Texas. These bangs were witnessed over the course of several weeks and sometimes they were accompanied with strange green light. In one of the locations, a geologist even stated that the booms and subsequent tremors were unlike anything he had ever encountered and didn’t fit the official explanation that the Air Force were testing a new plane.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">8. The Nine Unknown Men</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/178507705-e1392666355560.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>The Nine Unknown Men are to India what the Illuminati is to the Western world, but even more pervasive and mysterious. According to legend, this powerful secret society was founded by Emperor Asoka in 273 BC after a bloody battle that took the lives of 100,000 men. The function of the Nine Unknown Men was to preserve and develop the sort of secret information that would be too dangerous in the hands of the uninitiated.<br />
<br />
Each of the Nine was tasked with holding a special book of knowledge, ranging from propaganda to microbiology. Some of them are even said to hold the secrets of anti-gravity and time travel. Occasionally, some of this precious information leaks out into the world—for instance, it is said that the martial art of Judo was based on “leaks” from the Book of Physiology.<br />
<br />
The number of the Unknown Men is always nine, and their undisguised contacts with the outside world are few and far between. Much like the Illuminati, there are many rumors about their current and past members. Strangely enough, not all of them are Indian—the Unknown Men are apparently spread all over the world, with some of them allegedly holding very prominent positions. Among suspected members of the Nine Unknown are the influential 10th century Pope Sylvester II and Vikram Sarabhai, the scientist who created India’s budding space program.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">7. The Great Taj Mahal Conspiracy</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/71263955.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>Taj Mahal is without question the most famous—and possibly the most beautiful—building in India. Considered one of the modern wonders of the world, this ornate white marble building was created by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum to his deceased wife. Or was it?<br />
<br />
According to some theories, Taj Mahal was never the architectural embodiment of eternal love history remembers it as. Instead, some evidence suggests that the building is actually about 300 years older than its supposed builder. New Delhi professor P.N. Oak, the man behind this theory, claims that the building was originally not a mausoleum at all. He suggests it is actually an ancient Hindu temple known as Tejo Mahalaya dedicated to the worship of the god Shiva. If true, this turns the entire history of TaJ Mahal on its head: Instead of building one of the world’s most precious constructions, Shah Jahan would merely have taken an existing temple, slapped on some decorations, and dedicated it to his wife.<br />
<br />
While this may seem far-fetched to those of us who like Taj Mahal as it is, it’s worth noticing that Indian royalty have a history of capturing enemy temples and mansions and repurposing them into tombs for their loved ones. What’s more, the memoirs of travelers in the area during the time of Taj Mahal’s supposed construction make no mention of its building and even note that the “Taj” already existed as an important, established building. Is Taj Mahal as the ultimate display of romance just a giant lie created by shoddy historians and propagandists? Until the Indian government agrees to open the sealed rooms within the building so they can be thoroughly investigated by experts, the mystery remains.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">6. The Cursed Village Of Kuldhara</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/91892859-e1392667150309.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>For over 500 years, the village of Kuldhara was populated by about 1,500 residents. One night, they all disappeared. They didn’t die or get abducted or anything—they just left. The reason for their sudden evacuation is lost in time. Some say they fled the taxation of an oppressive rulers, while others weave a tale of young lovers and the girl’s angry father who was a big shot at the village.<br />
<br />
Whatever the actual cause of desertion, one thing is generally agreed upon—when the villagers left, they cursed the area so that no one may live there ever again. Of course, some people tried to take over the cozy, abandoned village. According to legend, all who tried died a brutal death. Some of the people who have died in there are said to still haunt the village, according to paranormal investigators who have experienced some very strange events in the place.<br />
<br />
Whether all of this is true or not, the village has certainly gained a frightening reputation. It remains deserted to this very day, and no one has even considered repopulating it for a long time.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">5. The Magnetic Hill Of Ladakh</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><iframe width="425" height="350" src="https://youtube.com/embed/EFTawyAz8D0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>In the region of Ladakh near the Himalayas, there is a very strange hill that is said to be magnetic. If you park your car on the road that leads to the top of the hill and leave it in neutral, it will roll up the steep road by its own accord, moving at speeds up to 20 kilometers per hour (12.4 mph). This wonderful natural—or, as some travel guides will tell you, supernatural—phenomenon is called a “Himalayan wonder” and is a popular attraction for the travelers of the area.<br />
<br />
The real truth behind the “Magnetic” Hill of Ladakh is pretty impressive, but sadly, not quite as mysterious. It’s actually just an optical illusion created by the peculiar geography of the area. The mountains, road, and hill are aligned in a very specific way that makes the area seem a steep uphill terrain, but the road actually goes slightly downhill. Thus, the car left out of gear in a certain point of the road will appear to roll uphill.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">4. The Immortal Beings Of The Himalayas</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/178469650.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>In many mythologies, mountains are natural homes to divine and immortal beings. As such, it’s no surprise that the world’s mightiest mountain range, the Himalayas, is subject to whisperings of mysterious beings hidden away in the valleys of the mountains.<br />
<br />
One popular legend among the practitioners of various New Age soul-searching methods is Gyanganj. It is said to be an ancient Indian and Tibetan tale of a city-kingdom of mysterious immortal beings that are hiding from the world, but influencing it in various subtle ways when needed. It is said that Gyanganj is cunningly camouflaged or even existing in a completely different plane of reality, which is why it has managed to avoid being discovered by modern mapping techniques and satellites.<br />
<br />
However, the immortal, enlightened sadhus and mahatmas that inhabit it are all too happy to let in a visitor every now and then, perhaps even sharing some of their wisdom with them. Many influential gurus and mystics have claimed the source of their knowledge of the arcane comes from visits to this mysterious place.</i></span></span></div><br />
<br />
<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">3. The Bhootbilli</span></span><br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/183593895-e1392668147648.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>The Bhootbilli, or “ghost cat,” is a mysterious monster that is terrorizing certain parts of India, particularly in the area of Pune. A strange cryptid that appears to be a cross between a cat, a dog, and a mongoose, it is responsible for killing livestock and frightening the locals. According to one eyewitness, the creature is ”fat and broad with a long tail, black in colour, has a face like a dog and back like a mongoose.” It is capable of long jumps, having at least once jumped in a tree to escape people who have tried to catch it. Despite this, it’s said to be quite large and ferocious—its size is described as ”smaller than a lion but bigger than a hyena.”<br />
<br />
Although there are many sightings of the beast and the locals seem certain that the monster haunting them is a creepy cryptid, it is worth noting that India has a history of overreacting to strange animal sightings. As such, some experts have expressed an opinion that the Bhootbilli is actually nothing more than a little civet cat and a lot of imagination.</i></span></span></div><br />

<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>The Kongka La Pass in Ladakh area is one of the least accessible places in the world. Not only is it located in the Himalayas, it is a disputed border area of India and China and has been the cause of armed conflict between the two countries in the past. As such, the area is more or less a no man’s land. Both countries keep an eye of it, but neither patrols it or occupies it. Perhaps this is why, according to some, the UFOs have chosen the area as their underground base.<br />
<br />
Reportedly, the Kongka La Pass holds a series of massive, hidden underground constructs that UFOs, particularly those of the flying saucer type, use as their base of operations. Many travelers and residents of nearby areas have claimed that UFOs are a common sight in the area, rising from their underground lairs and descending back once they’ve done whatever it is UFOs go out to do.<br />
<br />
People say both Chinese and Indian governments are very aware of what’s going on and may even be cooperating with the extraterrestrials said to pilot the mysterious airships. Indeed, Google Earth has revealed that some supposed underground entrances have what look a lot like military facilities built around them.</i></span></span></div><br />

<br />
<div class="center"><img class="lazyjs bbcodeImage" <br>src="images/blank.gif" data-original="http://listverse.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/153171502-e1392668532923.jpg" alt="image" /></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:gray"><i>Shanti Devi was born in a happy Delhi family in 1930s. However, she didn’t stay happy for long. When she was four years old, she started insisting that her mother and father were not her true parents. She claimed that her name was actually Ludgi and her true family lived in a completely different city. She claimed she had died giving birth to a child and gave very specific information on her husband and family life.<br />
<br />
Shanti’s worried parents set out to find if there was any meaning behind their daughter’s outlandish claims, and what they found out was truly unnerving. A young woman named Ludgi Devi had indeed died in childbirth at the time and in the town Shanti had specified, and the family and relatives she had described very much existed. When she eventually met her “husband from previous life,” she recognized him instantly and acted like a mother towards his child.<br />
<br />
The newspapers soon became interested and authorities as revered as Mahatma Gandhi were soon keenly watching Shanti’s case. It turned out she was not only able to remember her past lives, but she could also remember the time “in between lives”—that is, the afterlife. She claimed to have met Lord Krishna during these layovers between her lives. The Lord tasked her with spreading the story of her experiences, which is why she was able to remember.<br />
<br />
Shanti Devi went on to be a scholar, teacher, and student of religion. For over sixty years, she embraced all major and quite a few minor religions’ teachings, trying to determine the universal truth behind them all, which was presumably the great mission she was given. Hundreds of researchers and scientists put her claims of reincarnation memories to the test, but no one was ever able to prove her a fake.</i></span></span></div><br />

<span style="color:gray"><i><span style="font-size:130%">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen "A. P. J." Abdul Kalam, the 11th President of India (2002-2007) has passed away in Shillong at an age of 83 Yrs. <br />
<br />
This is the most devastating news to India as a Whole. He has been a great Scientist (Known to be the Father of Indian Rocket Science), A great President and the most inspirational person to millions of people around the world.</span></i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:160%"><span style="color:red"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About Abdul Kalam</span></span>:</span><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="color:gray"><i><span style="font-size:130%">Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father's name was Jainulabudeen, a boat owner, and his mother Ashiamma, a housewife. He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family's income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to contribute to his father's income. In his school years he had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his education at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954 Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF (Indian Air Force).<br />
<br />
After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist. He started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile. Kalam Also served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Defense Research and Development Organization from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role.<br />
<br />
At a time when India was struggling to develop missile technology, he spearheaded India's efforts by serving as the head of the missile program-me which earned him the sobriquet 'India's Missile Man.<br />
<br />
Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticized for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.<br />
<br />
After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and the Indian Institute of Management Indore, an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.<br />
<br />
In 1998, along with cardiologist Dr.Soma Raju of CARE Hospitals Hyderabad, Kalam developed a low cost Coronary stent. It was named as "Kalam-Raju Stent" honouring them. In 2012, the duo, designed a rugged tablet PC for health care in rural areas, which was named as "Kalam-Raju Tablet".<br />
<br />
Kalam has also been an active member in various social programmes in India. In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kalam's 79th birthday was recognized as World Student Day by the United Nations. He has also received honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The Government of India has honored him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific adviser to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernization of defense technology in India. In 2005, Switzerland declared 26 May as "Science Day" to commemorate Kalam's visit to the country. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project."<br />
<br />
On 27 July 2015, Kalam traveled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth." at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST.</span></i></span></div><br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="color:gray"><i><span style="font-size:130%">Kalam's death was marked with an outpouring of grief in India, with numerous tributes made to the former President across the nation and on social media. The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect.</span></i></span></div><br />
<br />
<div class="quote">"I got to work with him closely. I have lost an uttam marg darshak. The country has lost a son who worked for the strength of India. He had spent every moment for the youth of India. No person will be able to fill the gap left by him. His work will inspire us to work for the development of the nation," Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, India.</div><br />
<div class="quote">"Kindly accept deepest condolences on sad passing away of the former President of India, Dr Abdul Kalam" - Vladimir Putin, President, Russia</div><br />
<div class="quote">"A scientist and statesman, Dr Kalam rose from humble beginnings to become one of India's most accomplished leaders, earning esteem at home and abroad" - Barack Obama, President, United States.</div><br />
<div class="quote">"I was honored to meet Dr Kalam when he visited Singapore in 2006. Our thoughts are with his family and the people of India during this time of sorrow," - Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister, Singapore.</div><br />
<div class="quote">"Kalam will be remembered for his meritorious services for his country" - Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister, Pakistan</div><br />
<div class="quote">"I am saddened to hear the news of passing away of Kalam" - Sushil Koirala, Prime Minister, Nepal.</div><br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="justify"><span style="color:gray"><i><span style="font-size:130%">Putting the facts apart, Kalam is a simple down to earth person. He has been an inspiration to many people all around the world. He is the greatest scientist India had ever made. It was only his gift to India that India has been able to stand beside many powerful nations in the field of Rocket Science for his key role in weaponizing India’s nuclear program.<br />
<br />
India Has lost one of its greatest gems it had ever made.<br />
A missile man passed away<br />
A great teacher passed away<br />
A motivator passed away<br />
A dreamer passed away<br />
A gentleman passed away</span></i></span></div><br />

Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing<br />
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision<br />
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen<br />
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing<br />
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome<br />
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't<br />
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach<br />
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?<br />
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?<br />
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely<br />
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony<br />
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful<br />
But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!<br />
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong<br />
Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!<br />
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get<br />
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit<br />

Way before my baby daughter Hailey<br />
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey<br />
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes<br />
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers<br />
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin<br />
And had me in the position to beat me into submission<br />
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,<br />
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat<br />
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"<br />
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe<br />
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!"<br />
The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)<br />
and started helpin him stomp me<br />
I made them think they beat me to death<br />
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left<br />
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth<br />
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws<br />
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools<br />
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,<br />
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.<br />
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.<br />
I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good."<br />
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could<br />
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood<br />
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..<br />
.. Made it home, later that same day<br />
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray<br />
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read<br />
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed<br />
My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!?<br />
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (Sorry!)<br />
She beat me over the head with the remote control<br />
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull<br />
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?!?"<br />
[M] "Oh my God, I'm sorry son"<br />
[E] "Shut up you cunt!" I said, "Fuck it!"<br />
Took it and stuck it back up in my head<br />
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck</span></i><br />

Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now<br />
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive<br />
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life<br />
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is fulla' saliva<br />
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house<br />
See, it's sad it came to this point<br />
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya<br />
But I ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology<br />
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek<br />
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window<br />
Like I reach my full potential–I peeked<br />
Continue to peep, still bent low<br />
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo<br />
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch<br />
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this<br />
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?<br />
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?<br />
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack-up a lung<br />
Like you picked an axe up and swung<br />
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk<br />
By one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?<br />
Now who's a faggot, you punk?<br />
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck<br />
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim<br />
I hope you hear it we're in a car right now<br />
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric<br />
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die<br />
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP<br />
Just to try to get people to buy<br />
Well how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun<br />
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done<br />
Eminem killed by M and M<br />
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials<br />
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it<br />
Since you're in love with your city so much<br />
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here<br />
Two more exits, time is quite near<br />
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear<br />
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea<br />
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror<br />
(Oh God, police!! Ah!!)<br />
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least<br />
New plan Stan<br />
Slim, "chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car!"<br />
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you<br />

But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off<br />
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on<br />

I remember back one year when daddy had no money<br />
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up<br />
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me<br />
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em<br />
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying<br />
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job<br />
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom<br />
And at the time every house that we lived in<br />
Either kept getting broken into and robbed<br />
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar<br />
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college<br />
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it<br />
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart<br />
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart<br />
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back<br />
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment<br />
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara<br />
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre<br />
And flew you and momma out to see me<br />
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me<br />
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it<br />
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it<br />
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit<br />
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<br />
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand<br />
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<br />
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing<br />
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out<br />
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now<br />
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here<br />
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here<br />
I like the sound of that, yeah<br />

But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher<br />

All the pain inside amplified by the fact<br />
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5<br />
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br />

And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br />

When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about<br />
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count<br />
Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out<br />
You probably think cause it's been so long<br />
if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now<br />
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down<br />

that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do<br />
and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you?<br />
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one<br />
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt<br />

Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky? Tell the public <br />
that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?<br />
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin?<br />
The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin<br />
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about<br />
how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely<br />
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling<br />
and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling<br />
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you<br />
And don't you dare say it isn't true<br />

I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued<br />

Oh, did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too<br />
Like I been goin off on you all this time<br />
for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind<br />

Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time<br />

Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do<br />
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through<br />
So homie this is your song I dedicate this to you<br />

hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin<br />
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun<br />
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in<br />
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous<br />
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is<br />
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace<br />
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this<br />
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em<br />
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets<br />
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches<br />
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous<br />
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin<br />
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")<br />
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin<br />
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started<br />

I think I was put here to annoy the world<br />
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl<br />
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer<br />
and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer<br />
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay<br />
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)<br />
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out<br />
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out<br />
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out<br />
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!<br />
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again<br />

for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped<br />
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass<br />
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man<br />
and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column<br />

you playin with motherfuckers lives, I done watched Dre<br />
get fucked on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it<br />
Now you fucked me outa my mics twice I let it slide<br />
I said I wouldnt hold my fucken breath to get a five<br />
Shit I was right, Ida fuckin died already tryin<br />
I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why<br />
you let that bitch give me that bullshit review<br />
I sat and took it, I aint look at the shit we knew<br />
You'd probly try to fuck us with Obie and 50 too<br />
F*ck a relationship we through<br />
No more Source with street cred, them days is dead<br />
Dre's got A-Ks to Dave May's head<br />
Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread<br />
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head<br />
That I am not afraid, hes just a fuckin waste of lead<br />
on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple<br />
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed<br />
This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed<br />
You dont know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk<br />
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little sell out mag<br />
I aint mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad<br />
You wanna talk about some shit that you dont know about? ya<br />
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there<br />
To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat<br />
Your never gonna blow bitch your just too old<br />
No wonder your sore now lordy your bored now<br />
Im pushin thirty your kickin fourty's door down<br />
Bitch this is war now, and youl never beat me<br />
all you do is cheat me out of QUATABLES but you know<br />
that youl always see me on your TV<br />
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin<br />
To see your video played once on bet<br />
So he-he-he who has the last laugh?<br />
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff<br />
kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back<br />
Just know that Benzinos wack<br />
no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack<br />
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back<br />
Look at your track record thats how far it goes back<br />
Its extortion n Ray own's a proportion<br />
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston<br />
Bullyin and bossin, Dave like a slave they've completely brainwashed him<br />
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest<br />
fakest, wannabe gangster in New York<br />
And its pitiful, cuz I would have never said shit to you if you'd have kept your mouth shut<br />
Bitch now what? Hit it Clue, spit it Slay<br />
New shit, exclusive, yo Lantern, Whoo Kid<br />
You know what to do with this: use it<br />

How can I moonlight on the side<br />
I have no life outside of that<br />
Don't I give you enough of my time<br />
You don't think so, do you?<br />
Jealous when I spend time with the girls<br />
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know<br />
But tonight I'm serving you with papers<br />
I'm divorcing you<br />
Go marry someone else and make em famous<br />
And take away their freedom like you did to me<br />
Treat em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you<br />
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat<br />
I'm moving on forget you oh,<br />
Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you<br />

Helplessness<br />
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch<br />

I fell for this so many times<br />
It's ridiculous<br />

I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction<br />
You're addictive as they get<br />
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em<br />

Cursed and blessed<br />

It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be<br />
Like trying to start over<br />
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster<br />
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over<br />

 <div class="textcontent botmarg10px blogContent"><span style="font-size:160%">Roughly Eight years back, I first noticed this bombarding beat by an artist named Eminem “Without Me”. I loved the music, The music video was funny and I’m clueless why this guy is dissing other people. “What an ass,” I said to myself and a few days later I was shocked to know he has won a Grammy for the track.<br />
<br />
The next few months I have been listening to all his work. I really enjoyed his music. His lyrics was undoubtedly offensive and abusive but what I found out was he is a damn good Poet, an excellent lyricist and OMG this dude is a brilliant storyteller. I have never heard anyone able to effectively indulge satire, rage, sorrow, guilt, regret, power, passion, loneliness, bravado, stupidity, idiocy, misogyny, sympathy and, believe it or not, tender compassion.<br />
<br />
And thus is the story of how I have been a huge fan of him since then.<br />
<br />
Marshall Mathers is simply a lyrical sniper with a shotgun, and vents more in a few hundred words than many are able to effectively communicate in pages of copy. When I listen to an Eminem record, I’m hearing a man who cares about every single syllable and the exact tone of its delivery. He is a modern version of William Shakespeare.<br />
<br />
This isn’t to say all his songs are good. In fact, each album has a handful of songs I find both repugnant and unendurable.<br />
<br />
I have made a compilation of his 100 greatest verses (in my opinion). This took me almost a month and trust me, this was really a tough job to choose..</span><br />
<br />

<span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">100.</span></span> <div class="center"><i><span style="color:grey">My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it<br />
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it<br />
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it<br />
It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon)<br />
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off<br />
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped<br />
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc<br />
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did<br />
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these<br />
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed<br />
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does<br />
and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids. ?</span></i><br />

it, flows too wet, nobody close to it, nobody says it, but still everybody knows the shit, the<br />
most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all<br />
so much, they make it all up, there's no such thing, like a female with good looks, who cooks<br />

Sleeping outside the door waiting in line<br />
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform<br />
The fire marshals know the venue's too small<br />
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans<br />
And some cum wad from out the parking lot<br />
Gets in an argument over a parking spot<br />
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off<br />
Missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door<br />
Into the same entrance hall now the strays flying all over the place<br />
Grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall<br />
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off<br />

Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off<br />
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find a nine<br />
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him<br />
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre<br />
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was<br />
I never saw him run so fast in my life<br />
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife<br />
There she is on the ground being trampled<br />
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her<br />
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit<br />
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin<br />
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee<br />
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it<br />
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps<br />
Looked up and I seen Swift shooting it out<br />
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with<br />
But Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four fifth. </span></i><br />

My head is swole, my confidence is up<br />
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable<br />

I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin, dawg<br />

As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight<br />
High off her love, drunk from her hate,<br />
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate<br />
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me<br />
She fucking hates me and I love it.<br />
"Wait! Where you going?"<br />
"I'm leaving you!"<br />
"No you ain't. Come back."<br />
We're running right back.<br />
Here we go again<br />
It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great<br />
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br />
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped<br />
Who's that dude?<br />

I was boostin, so influenced by music I used it<br />
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid<br />
No one can tell me nothin hip-hop overwhelmed me<br />
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm<br />
It was like isolatin myself was healthy<br />
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy<br />
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me<br />
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me<br />
I was nothin, and I wouldn't amount to shit<br />
I made my first million and counted it<br />

I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky<br />
Right outside of the window of my living room<br />
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them itunes<br />
If I don't try to record as much before I do<br />
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can<br />
As I stand before you in this booth a walking deadman<br />
Blank stare dead pan look as my face as I gaze into space<br />
As I wait to be scooped up in that van<br />
Mysteriously disappear into thin air<br />
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of no where<br />
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech<br />
Who hid behind the freedom of speech<br />
Tryed to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it<br />
And ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters (?)<br />
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous<br />
In remembrance of september 11<br />
Flash back to september 7th<br />
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas<br />
He said that he predicted his own death<br />
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it<br />
Like the day John F Kennedy was assasinated in broad day<br />
By a craze lunatic with a gun<br />
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository<br />
Where the President would go for a little friday stroll<br />
Shots fired from the grassy knoll<br />
But they don't know or do they?<br />
Whos they for them to say Touch©<br />
Where all vunerable and it's spooky<br />
This is about as cookey as I've ever felt now<br />
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown<br />
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br />

That you're just now seeing the downside to<br />
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too<br />
Ain't even sure if your kids like you<br />
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill<br />

 <div class="textcontent botmarg10px blogContent">Perhaps, one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word <b><span style="font-size:150%"><span style="color:orange">'fuck’</span></span></b>. It is one magical word: just by its sound it can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love.<br />
<br />
In language, it falls into many grammatical categories.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:110%">It can be used as a verb,</span><br />
<i><b><span style="font-size:150%">Transitive</span></b> - <span style="font-size:200%"><span style="color:red">John fucked Mary.</span></span></i><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:135%">As you can see, there are not many words with the versatility of ‘fuck’. Besides the sexual meaning, there are also the following uses:</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:150%"><b>Anxiety:</b></span> <span style="color:red"><span style="font-size:200%">Today is really fucked.</span></span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:135%">It can be used in an anatomical description</span> - <span style="font-size:200%"><span style="color:red">"He's a fucking asshole."</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:135%">It can be used to tell time</span> - <span style="font-size:200%"><span style="color:red">"It's five fucking thirty."</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:120%">It has also been used by many notable people throughout history:</span><br />
<br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"What the fuck was that?" - Mayor of Hiroshima</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"Where did all these fucking Indians come from?" - General Custer</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"Where the fuck is all this water coming from?" - Captain of the Titanic</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"That's not a real fucking gun." - John Lennon</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"Who's gonna fucking find out?" - Richard Nixon</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"Heads are going to fucking roll." - Anne Boleyn</span></div><br />
<div class="quote"><span style="font-size:200%">"Let the fucking woman drive." - Commander of Space Shuttle</span></div><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:120%">And it is very healthy too. If every morning you do it as a Transcendental Meditation — just when you get up, the first thing, repeat the mantra <span style="color:orange">“Fuck you!”</span> five times — it clears the throat.</span><br />
