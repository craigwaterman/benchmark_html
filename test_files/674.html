I can say, with a heart full of gratitude, that my childhood dreams came true. I’ve often thought to myself, “I have everything I ever wanted.”</p><p>I have two beautiful children. They’re healthy. They’re smart. They’re kind. My son is now almost as tall as I am, and it amazes me that he once grew inside my body. He is so funny. And creative. I love this kid deep in my soul. And my daughter. Oh, she has such a tender place in my heart! She delights in spending time with me. She is affectionate. She’s artistic. Her hair is starting to get curly, and when I look at her I’m captivated.&nbsp;</p><p>Why am I so blessed to have these two little people to call my own? I thank God constantly for my children. I feel like I was made to be a mom.</p><p>Don’t you think the way a human life begins is fascinating? It is truly a miracle when a human being is conceived and then grows inside a mother’s womb. Only God can orchestrate such a miracle. But He allows man and woman to take part, especially the woman, whose body houses that child. I was able to experience that miracle twice.</p><p>But it just felt like that wasn’t enough.</p><p>I wanted another child after my daughter Ivy. What reason could there possibly be to NOT take part in creating another human being? I loved being pregnant. The baby moved inside my belly. It was wondrous! And what about the birth! OK, OK, I remember the labor was very (ahem) unpleasant, but meeting that baby?? It was incredible. Holding him or her for the first time? So precious.</p><p>Then over time, the wonder of getting to know that baby as an individual. All those cuddles, smiles, laughs…Fine, I remember all the hard stuff too, like the sleeplessness, ear infections, teething, poopy diapers...But to me, the joy of having a little person to love far outweighs the challenges.</p><p>And I just wanted another little person to love.</p><p>When my youngest was about 18 months old, I started trying to convince my husband that we should have another baby. My argument was: what reason could there possibly be to not take part in creating another human being? One more person to love. There’s no way this could be the wrong decision.</p><p>Well, my husband was convinced it was the wrong decision. He loves our children to pieces. Seriously, he is an outstanding father. But he couldn’t ignore our financial situation. We have student loans to pay off. We don’t have a good retirement plan. Our budget is tight and we live month-to-month. Neither one of us has chosen a very lucrative career. He ended up convincing me it just wasn’t wise to add another person to our family.</p><p>But I kept the secret dream alive in my heart.</p><p>I thought maybe I’d accidentally get pregnant! Then I’d get what I wanted without the weight of wondering if we made the right choice. I briefly considered <em>helping </em>with “accidentally” getting pregnant…but I quickly dismissed it because I could not use deception to create a child. I wouldn’t be able to take full joy in the pregnancy knowing I had tricked my husband into it.</p><p>So then I just decided to wait. And trust God. I just kept assuming that one day our financial situation would change, and then my husband would have to agree that another baby was meant for us!</p><p>And I grieved. Over the years, it sometimes hurt to see friends, or my own sister, having three or four babies. A “big” family. Sometimes baby showers were hard. Sometimes going to the hospital to meet a brand new baby was hard. I wanted to be there again. With my own new baby in my arms.</p><p>I choose to trust God in all things. This was no exception. His ways are higher than ours, and we do not understand why we don’t always get the desires of our hearts, even lovely desires like children.</p><p>“’For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,’ declares the Lord. ‘As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.’” Isaiah 55:8-9</p><p>Every once in awhile, as I prayed I’d wonder if God was going to fulfill the longing in my heart. I know He sees me. And loves me. I sometimes thought I felt Him promising me that He would fulfill my dream of having another child.</p><p>Well, time passed, and I’m not getting any younger. I’ll be 40 in a couple months. This summer I realized that if another pregnancy was going to happen, it had better happen soon. I decided to talk to my husband.</p><p>We were on a date, sitting outside at a picnic table. And I presented to him how I had secretly longed for the past 7 years to have another child. And then, I asked him if we could. He was kind. But resolute. He pointed out that our financial situation was actually worse than it had been 7 years ago. And that it would be very challenging to go all the way back to the infant stage when our kids are now 9 and 11. I agreed with him. It was all so logical…but I started to cry. Right there in public. I asked him to please, please at least recognize how much it hurt me to let go of that other child. I asked him to understand how frustrating it was that money, something that seems so superficial, decided that another person was not meant for our family. He was gentle with me, and I appreciated it. I was never angry with him over this. More just disappointed in the circumstances that controlled our decision.</p><p>I left there that day carrying a sad song in my heart:&nbsp;“I will never be pregnant again. I will never be pregnant again.”</p><p>But…</p><p>Have you heard that God makes beauty from ashes? Isaiah 61:1-3 says, “…He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.”</p><p>God never promises to give us everything we ever want, but He does promise to fulfill us in ways we didn’t know were possible.</p><p>I’ve been doing a Bible study by Beth Moore called “Breaking Free.” This morning the study dealt with the desire that women have “to be fruitful.” For many of us, that means we desire to bear children. Sadly, some women desire to have children and cannot, due to various reasons such as infertility or possibly because they never marry. The author Beth Moore touched on barrenness.&nbsp; As I read through the lesson, I was thinking of women I know who have faced infertility. I kept thinking how Beth’s words would encourage them. She said that while it is a natural and precious desire for a woman to want to have children, sometimes God does not fulfill that desire with physical offspring.</p><p>“Sing, O barren woman, you who never bore a child; burst into song, shout for joy, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.” Isaiah 54:1</p><p>How can a barren woman have more “children” than a married woman who actually gave birth? Beth Moore said that underneath women’s desires to have babies is “a desire to have fruitful lives, to invest ourselves in something that matters. Something that affects. Something that grows.”</p><p>A barren woman can give birth to ministries that are great and that bear much fruit. She can invest in spiritual children, and believers in the Lord can multiply. Lives can grow. Be nurtured. Be changed by her.</p><p>Beth Moore wrote: “My dear friend Johnnie Haines has two fine sons who are her pride and joy. She always longed to have a daughter in addition to her sons, but she never had that daughter. One day she said to me, ‘My boys are virtually grown and I love them so much, but I still wonder from time to time why God never gave me the daughter I longed for too.’ But, you see, He did! For 10 years she led the women’s ministry at a large church in Houston. She mothered numerous young women! The women under her direction are now mature believers who are serving God effectively in their homes, workplaces, and churches.”</p><p>Suddenly I recognized myself. Longing for another child that God never gave? That’s me!</p><p>Beth Moore continued: “I have another friend by the name of Rhonda Kelley, author of <em>Life Lessons from Women in the Bible.</em> God never gave the Kelleys physical offspring, but He has given them more spiritual offspring than any parents I know! Her husband is a seminary president and she teaches and mentors on the campus both professionally and personally. Only heaven will boast the number of offspring Chuck and Rhonda really have. Their loss was glory’s gain. At this point, I believe both of them would testify that God ultimately did not restrict them from childbearing. Rather, He loosened the restrictions and made them enlarge their tents! The potential for spiritual offspring in the lives of those physically barren is virtually limitless. If He restricts you from physical offspring, He desires to set you free from restrictions in order to bear spiritual offspring.”</p><p>Do you find this to be beautiful? I do. I confess that I have not faced infertility, or other heart-breaking losses like miscarriages or stillbirth. I cannot even pretend to understand that kind of grief. But God can. He sees.</p><p>“The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” Psalm 34:18</p><p>I recognize that my own sorrow over not being able to have <em>another </em>healthy child does not compare to the depth of grief some women have faced in greater childbearing losses. I write today to encourage all of us who have faced disappointment when our dreams of motherhood did not match our reality. A friend of mine encouraged me not long ago by saying, “Just because your hurt isn’t as big as mine does not make your hurt less valid.” That meant a lot to me.</p><p>As I read on in the Bible study this morning, Beth Moore wrote: “As we’ve seen today, even the book of Isaiah says that those who are barren can have more offspring than those who are able to conceive and give birth. In fact, barrenness at any point in life affords great opportunity for spiritual offspring. If we live long enough, each of us will be barren. Are we to assume our fruitfulness has ended?” She wrote about the sense of loss she felt at times as she saw her two daughters grow up and leave home. She wrote: “Sometimes I think, ‘Whatever will I do? I was born to be a mommy!’ Then I remember that God has called me primarily to women’s ministry and I will always have the opportunity to ‘mother’ a few spiritual offspring as long as I’m willing to invest myself.”</p><p>Oh, friends, how this spoke to me! I have begun to invest myself in ministry. I lead Bible study. I make it a point to encourage friends with scripture. I teach Sunday school. And, most dear to my heart, I’ve begun writing this blog with the purpose of bringing glory to God and encouraging others. I realize that I have room for these things because I’m not raising a baby at this point in my life.</p><p>God didn’t give me another child. Baby Pearl only ever existed in my dreams. She won’t ever grow within me, underneath my heart. I won’t get to hold her in my arms. I won’t get to see her grow into a little person who learns new things and who makes me laugh. Today as I processed this, I had a good, long cry. I grieved again for the child I’ll never have. The result was some red, puffy eyes and a whole lot of used tissues. But also, a new wisdom was given to me today. God is showing me that He is fulfilling my desire for more children in other ways.</p><p>For a long time, I have had a dream of writing. It is a dream that grew underneath my heart, where that other baby never grew. And now, through this blog, that dream is being fulfilled.</p><p>This is my pearl.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1447818981127_7530"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Everything about her looks soft. And her eyes are bright. And you want to touch her hair. And maybe just stare at her all day because she’s so beautiful.</p><p>Until she starts whining. And acting selfish. Suddenly she’s considerably less beautiful.</p><p>Last year in my preschool class, we teachers noticed some of our adorable little girls acting…well, not very adorable. They argued with each other. Tattled on each other. Acted bossy. We decided to teach them an important lesson. We sat all the students on the rug and pointed out how their teachers liked to look pretty. We liked to do our hair and wear jewelry and cute shoes, etc.…But then we said it’s even more important to <em>act </em>pretty. We began to yell at each other and snatch toys from each other and say, “IT’S MINE! GIVE IT TO ME!” We pouted. We whined. We stomped our feet. (The little students found this display fascinating!) Then we paused and asked, “Was that acting very pretty? Or did our actions look ugly?” They all agreed it was not pretty to act that way. Then we told them how pretty and handsome every single one of them was on the outside because God made each of them unique and precious. But we told them they had to choose to be pretty on the inside. Because that pleases God, and it also makes them feel proud and happy at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Later throughout the year, we would sometimes remind some of the little girls to “be pretty on the inside!” Or we would tell them we noticed they were being pretty on the inside. They would beam with pride.&nbsp;</p><p>I am well past the age of four years old, but I still desperately want to be pretty on the inside. God sees every corner of my heart, and I want Him to be pleased. Also, God wants us to bring Him glory. He wants us to reflect His character so that others will be drawn into relationship with Him. Reflecting God means we choose to live in a way that is beautiful.</p><p>“Those who look to Him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.” Psalm 34:5</p><p>So what does pretty on the inside look like? I heard a sermon on the radio this morning by Pastor Dee Duke of Jefferson Baptist Church. It was titled “Beauty Contest,” and it listed the characteristics that make a person beautiful and attractive to others. He said people who don’t know Jesus will not believe in Him unless they see His beauty reflected in those of us who do know Him.&nbsp;</p><p>Pastor Dee listed these beautiful character traits:</p><p><strong>1. Joyfulness is beautiful.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We cannot control our circumstances, but we do get to choose our attitude. Choose to be happy. In spite of rotten circumstances. What if things in your life seem to be falling apart? What if you just can’t catch a break? Be happy anyway. Do not just be a victim of circumstances that you have no control over. Choose joy no matter what. Is it phony to always be joyful? No, it’s not phony; it’s obedient.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!” Philippians 4:4</p><p>“You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.” Psalm 16:11</p><p>If you continually choose to <em>act happy</em> when you don’t <em>feel happy, </em>eventually you will feel it! Recently at preschool, a little girl was missing her parents and didn’t want to participate in class activities. We teachers decided to add some special activities and put on a big display about how much FUN we were having so that she would join in. It was all an intentional act, but when the day was over, I realized that because we were pretending to have so much fun, I started to believe we really were having the best day at preschool ever! We acted happy and then became happy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Patience is beautiful.</strong></p><p>It’s not pleasant to be around someone who is easily angered and irritated. It’s not pleasant to listen to someone continually complain. It’s like fingernails on a chalkboard.&nbsp; Be someone who is patient and doesn’t always find fault with others.&nbsp;</p><p>“My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man’s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.” James 1:19-20</p><p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs.” 1 Corinthians 13:4-5</p><p><strong>3. Selflessness is beautiful.</strong></p><p>We think we have to look out for Number One. We feel we have rights. If we think our rights have been violated, we get angry. We want to stand up for ourselves! But God says to give our rights to Him and He will defend us. God says think of others first instead of always looking out for ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.” Philippians 2:3</p><p>“Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.” Romans 12:10</p><p><strong>4. Graciousness of speech is beautiful.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Often it isn’t what you say but how you say it. The tone someone uses when making a comment to you can offend. When someone points out a mistake I’ve made, if he/she does it with graciousness, I am not offended. I feel corrected but not criticized. But if the person were to say something like, “Did you realize you spelled my name wrong?” with an accusing tone, I would be offended.</p><p>I offended my son last night with a lack of graciousness. I was standing in the kitchen making dinner, a chore I do not enjoy, when my son said he was starving and wanted a snack. I told him to get himself a banana or yogurt. He asked, “Can I have a bagel?” (I toast his bagels in the broiler for him). I snapped at him, “No! I’m already standing here making <em>your </em>dinner! I’m not going to make you a snack!” He quietly said, “I was just asking. You don’t need to freak out on me like that. I didn’t know you were too busy.” I apologized. I knew I shouldn’t have spoken to him that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” Ephesians 4:29</p><p>“Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” Colossians 4:6</p><p>“Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.” Proverbs 16:24</p><p><strong>5. Loyalty is beautiful.</strong></p><p>Gossip and slander are ugly. I remember this quote from back in high school: “Whoever gossips to you will gossip about you.” I also like this one: “What Susie says about Sally says more about Susie than it does about Sally.” Don’t put others down behind their back.&nbsp; It is so unattractive to hear people criticizing others. Also, be trustworthy. Don’t spread news that isn’t yours to share. Hold your tongue. I have had a friend tell me very personal (negative) information about a mutual friend, and the immediate reaction in my mind was, “Whoa, mental note not to tell this girl anything personal because she will go tell others!”</p><p>“He who covers an offense promotes love, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.” Proverbs 17:9</p><p>“Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.&nbsp; Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.” Proverbs 3:3-4</p><p><strong>6. Kindness is beautiful.</strong></p><p>We have all experienced kindness. When someone actually sees our need, whether it be helping us with something, giving an encouraging word, bestowing a thoughtful gift, offering financial assistance, praying for us, or showing any other act of kindness, it is so powerful. And so humbling that someone went out of their way for us. Somehow it means the world that someone thought of you.</p><p>“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Ephesians 4:32</p><p>“Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes or daily food. If one of you says to him, ‘Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,’ but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?” James 2:15-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Forgiveness is beautiful.</strong></p><p>Bitterness is ugly. Holding a grudge benefits no one. Seth and I watch a lot of 48 Hours Mystery, and sometimes the family members of a victim refuse to forgive the perpetrator. You can see the harsh bitterness seeping through their words. And I wish I could tell them to forgive so that they can free themselves and so they can stop being ugly within. Forgiving someone does not mean that what the person did to you is OK. But forgiveness is choosing to not let their betrayal/offense control you any more. You may have heard this quote: “Unforgiveness is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.” Bitterness is toxic. It rots the bones.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, Jesus Christ died on the cross so that every sin we will ever commit could be forgiven. He gave us the free gift of salvation. Not one of us deserves this incredible gift. So in return, God calls us to <em>forgive others. </em>Always. Again and again. If we say we love Jesus and yet display unforgiveness, we are not reflecting Christ at all. He came to BE our forgiveness. If you are struggling with this, I urge you to get on your knees and surrender your bitterness to the Lord. <em>It</em> <em>is not about whether the other person deserves forgiveness. </em>They don’t. None of us do. It is about Jesus commanding you to forgive. How can we possibly thank Him for His gift of forgiveness to us and then refuse forgiveness to another person?</p><p>“Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.”&nbsp; Colossians 3:13</p><p>“Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ‘Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.’” Matthew 18:21-22</p><p>So, being beautiful means reflecting Jesus. Be joyful. Be patient. Be selfless. Have graciousness in speech. Be loyal. Be kind. Forgive.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only a few years ago that I started to believe I was pretty on the outside. And at the same time, I realized I’m aging. Outward beauty will not last. It is inevitably fleeting. A few years ago I stumbled upon a lovely book called <em>A Well-Tended Soul: Staying Beautiful For the Rest of Your Life </em>by Valerie Bell.<em> </em>It says that a beautiful soul can actually grow more beautiful over time. The physical body does not have that luxury. Here is an excerpt from the introduction of the book: “Jesus spoke of spiritual life as abundant life…a life marked by deep joy, regardless of circumstances, of real contentment instead of driving restlessness, an all-is-well relationship with God that leads to profound inner peace, commitment and connection to other people on a soulish intimate level, beauty that transcends age, wealth that is more than material…We were created for that kind of beauty—the beauty of a life formed to God’s heart.” As I read that book, I determined that I would always draw from the Lord an inner beauty, which will not fade.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.” 1 Peter 3:3-4</p><p>A few years ago, a precious lady from my church passed away. She was in her 90s. She was wrinkled and gray-haired, but I tell you, she was beautiful. Tears come to my eyes as I think of her. She had a sparkle in her eyes. She displayed joy. She displayed loyalty to her family. And she loved her God. I want to be like her! At her memorial service someone stood up and said, “When you’re young, you’re beautiful because you’re young. When you’re old, you’re beautiful because of God.”</p><p>Oh, it is my heart’s desire! To reflect my Jesus more and more as the years pass.&nbsp; Please let it be so.&nbsp;</p><p>“I pray Thee, O God, that I may be beautiful within.” -Socrates-</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I started to cry.&nbsp; And panic.&nbsp; I said, “No, no, please, God, I don’t want to write about that!”&nbsp;</p><p>But at the same time, I knew that it was right.&nbsp; My goal in starting a blog was to bring glory to God, to tell my story in a way that shows how amazing He is.&nbsp; And I knew the little squirrel would do it.</p><p>But I still didn’t want to.&nbsp; I said, “Please don’t make me write about that!&nbsp; It’s embarrassing!&nbsp; It just doesn’t feel safe!”</p><p>But then God reminded me that He doesn’t want me to live a “safe” life.&nbsp; He wants me to be reckless.&nbsp; To do anything He asks in order that He may be glorified. To pour out my life in surrender to Him.&nbsp; Because HE is Lord.&nbsp; I am not. So I just kept crying.&nbsp; My tears and my mascara soaked my bed sheet.&nbsp; Because I was so afraid.&nbsp; And because I knew I would never say no to my precious Savior.&nbsp; How could I ever tell Him no when He has been so good to me?</p><p>So, here goes.&nbsp; This one feels like me bleeding my heart out in front of you.&nbsp; And I am terrified.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to start way back.&nbsp; Like in high school.&nbsp; I always wanted a boyfriend, and yet no boys ever liked me. I didn’t get to go on dates. And so I didn’t feel pretty.&nbsp; I felt fat.&nbsp; I didn’t like my clothes.&nbsp; I always wished I looked different.&nbsp; I always wished I could be admired.&nbsp; I watched cheesy movies like “License To Drive” and wished I could be someone’s Dream Girl.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1445227314258_35449"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Still wishing I was really pretty. Still seeking admiration from people. Nothing seemed to satisfy this longing to feel good enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And then, sometime after Ivy was born, to put it plainly, I started to be prettier. It wasn’t really intentional.&nbsp; I lost some weight.&nbsp; I went back to work and bought cute clothes.&nbsp; I was friendly and outgoing.&nbsp; And I started to get compliments on my appearance.&nbsp; A lot.</p><p>And then there are those compliments you get without any words being spoken.&nbsp; Specifically, getting “checked out” by men.&nbsp; And when I noticed that happening, I have to admit, it felt great.&nbsp; It felt like the attention I always wanted as a young girl was finally coming my way!&nbsp; I. Enjoyed. It.</p><p>Ummm, except, I’m MARRIED and all, so I’m not supposed to be looking to any other male for attention besides my sweet husband.&nbsp; But I felt like I couldn’t help it!&nbsp; It was so much fun.&nbsp;</p><p>(Pleeeease bear with me and be gentle, my friends.&nbsp; This is so embarrassing).</p><p>It got to the point where my main focus each day was trying to look “hot.” And seem like the perfect woman.&nbsp; I wanted single men to wish they could find a wife like me, and (gulp) married men to wish their wives were more like me.&nbsp; Ghaaaaa, I hate saying it!&nbsp; It’s so selfish! It’s so ugly!&nbsp; But it’s true.&nbsp;</p><p>I have always loved Jesus.&nbsp; And He tried to tell me again and again over several years that I needed to give this up.&nbsp; It was wrong.&nbsp; It was vanity.&nbsp; It made me feel so guilty that I felt distant from God and distant from my husband.&nbsp; But I enjoyed it. So I kept looking for more.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I told a couple of my close girlfriends about what was in my heart.&nbsp; I revealed the struggle.&nbsp; I revealed my temptation to seek male attention and my guilt in knowing it was wrong.&nbsp; My friends prayed for me.&nbsp; They understood that I was caught in a battle between honoring God (and my husband!), or choosing to indulge myself and feed my ego.</p><p>I started to get so EXHAUSTED by the struggle.&nbsp; I wanted a way out.&nbsp; But what could it be??&nbsp; I just kept giving in to this. Until one night I remembered a book I had glanced through once at the Christian bookstore.&nbsp; And with hope in my heart I set out to find it.&nbsp; I prayed there would be a copy waiting for me when I got there.&nbsp;</p><p>There was.&nbsp;</p><p>And then….there was hope.</p><p>It is called <em>Every Woman’s Battle</em>, and it is a companion to the book <em>Every Man’s Battle.&nbsp; Every Man’s Battle </em>helps Christian men overcome the struggle with lust of the eyes when they look at women.&nbsp; <em>Every Woman’s Battle </em>helps Christian women overcome the struggle with relationship lust, how we want to be desirable and we want to receive compliments and how that can lead to emotional affairs.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1445227314258_57386"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Crap.&nbsp; My husband is sweet and wonderful and amazing.&nbsp; And I’m supposed to tell him I am constantly looking for attention from other men??&nbsp; Ghaaaaaaaa.&nbsp; I’m such a jerk.&nbsp; I kind of hate myself.&nbsp;</p><p>But I did it.&nbsp; I told him. I remember it was a sunny morning and the kids were at school. I remember praying that morning and God prompting me that it was time.&nbsp; This was the day.&nbsp; I was beyond nervous…but it was time. Sin will continue to flourish in the dark, but once it is exposed to the light it must flee.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.&nbsp; But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.” John 3:20-21</p><p>As I’m reliving this for you, I just had to pause and cover my face and cry.&nbsp; I hate remembering that day.&nbsp; It really, really hurt him.&nbsp; My husband has always been so good to me, you guys.&nbsp; I don’t even deserve this kind of man.&nbsp; I hate that I was so selfish that I dishonored him in this way.&nbsp; And you know he forgave me.&nbsp; Not immediately. It took a few days.&nbsp; But he loves me, and he knew that I was revealing this ugliness in my heart because I wanted it to END.&nbsp; I wanted to stop living that way.&nbsp; So he forgave me.&nbsp;</p><p>Forgiveness is so powerful. It is so undeserved.&nbsp; God forgives us of our sins when we accept that Jesus died for us on the cross and that He saved us from hell.&nbsp; We do not deserve this forgiveness.&nbsp; And He tells us we must forgive one another in the same way. My husband did that for me.&nbsp;</p><p>So….You’re wondering when I’m going to get to the little squirrel, right?</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1445227314258_74794"><div class="sqs-block-content">

She told me to avoid all situations that make me weak to my temptation.&nbsp; She said if I was a recovering alcoholic, and I drove past the bar each day on my way home from work, it would be time for me to CHOOSE A NEW ROUTE!! Why put myself in situations that will likely lead to failure? That was some wise advice, friends! I put that into action immediately.</p><p>Something else I heavily relied on was the armor of God.&nbsp; (Ephesians 6:10-18).&nbsp; I read that passage every morning to protect myself in the spiritual battle I would face that day.&nbsp; “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” (v.12) We do have an enemy, and the last thing he wants is for us to walk in freedom and bring glory to Jesus Christ.&nbsp; My favorite part of the armor of God is the belt of truth.&nbsp; Because whenever we sin, it’s because we are believing a lie.&nbsp; I continually reminded myself of this truth:&nbsp; THERE IS NO GREATER JOY THAN PLEASING GOD. To me, that meant that I might be tempted to seek male attention because it felt fun, but really, absolutely nothing feels better than pleasing God.&nbsp; I used that truth, and the belt of truth, many times to prevent myself from doing something I knew was wrong.</p><p>So, what about the little squirrel??</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1445227314258_84272"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Listen to worship music.&nbsp; Light candles.&nbsp; Just create an environment and the time that would let you commune with God.&nbsp; And the beauty of this would be that the intimacy you would have with God would be far better than any attention from men.</p><p>“Taste and see that the Lord is good.” Psalm 34:8</p><p>I decided to do something like that.&nbsp; The kids were staying at my parents’ house, and Seth was attending a conference out of town.&nbsp; I packed my Bible.&nbsp; My music.&nbsp; My journal.&nbsp; And I went for a hike at my favorite park.&nbsp; I was there to ask God for help.&nbsp; I wanted Him to help me overcome this battle.&nbsp; I wanted the struggle to end.&nbsp; I wanted a word from Him.&nbsp;</p><p>“I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.” Psalm 34:4</p><p>I was paying attention to everything.&nbsp; The trees.&nbsp; The birds.&nbsp; My music.&nbsp; I was waiting to hear from Him.&nbsp; I found a spot by the creek to sit.&nbsp; I was alone.&nbsp; I got out my Bible.&nbsp; I found some powerful verses that I decided to memorize.&nbsp; 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 “For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world.&nbsp; On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.”</p><p>As I was sitting there, listening to the creek, I saw a little squirrel.&nbsp; He was high up in the branches of a tree, off to the right of where I sat on the creek bank.&nbsp; He was making quite a commotion.&nbsp; I immediately tuned in to him.&nbsp; Was this God trying to tell me something??&nbsp; The squirrel was leaping around the very tops of the trees, where the branches were wispy and flimsy.&nbsp; He kept barely making it to safety!&nbsp; I gasped more than once!&nbsp; I thought, “I have never seen any squirrel do this in my entire life!”&nbsp; He was after some white petals.&nbsp; He’d stop and desperately nibble them from time to time.&nbsp; Then he’d dangerously travel to another ridiculously flimsy branch, and devour more petals.&nbsp; I watched him intently.&nbsp; I said, “God, am I supposed to be getting something from this? I came out here to get a word from You, and what I’m seeing is a crazy little squirrel.”&nbsp; As I continued to watch I kept thinking to myself, “Why would this little squirrel be putting on such a show for me when I’m asking God to meet me here? Is this God talking to me? This is so weird.”&nbsp;</p><p>After about 20 minutes, the little squirrel wandered off.&nbsp; The whole thing was odd.&nbsp; I didn’t get it.&nbsp; I figured it was just a nutty little creature interrupting my quest to hear from God.&nbsp;</p><p>After awhile I went home.&nbsp; Hours later, I was alone, so I lit candles and even put rose petals on the carpet, so I could have a special time of prayer with God.&nbsp; I got down on my face on the carpet.&nbsp; I told God I needed to hear from Him.&nbsp; Then I concentrated on the sound of the ticking clock so that my mind would be uncluttered by my own thoughts.&nbsp; I wanted to hear God.&nbsp; So I waited.</p><p>“The little squirrel.”</p><p>I heard that in my mind.&nbsp; I said, “What?&nbsp; Was that you, God? The little squirrel? What about him?…I seriously don’t get it.&nbsp; You’re going to have to be more clear.” So I waited.</p><p>“The little squirrel.”</p><p>“OK…..I don’t get it! What??”</p><p>“The little squirrel.&nbsp; He was so HUNGRY.&nbsp; He almost fell.&nbsp; Christi, you have been so hungry for attention that you have put yourself and your marriage in danger.&nbsp; You have almost fallen!”</p><p>I started to cry.&nbsp; God was right.&nbsp; I had been seeking attention so much that I had put myself in danger.&nbsp; That little squirrel risked his very life for those stupid petals.</p><p>I did not want to be him anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And now?&nbsp; I am free.&nbsp; My friends, Jesus has set me free.&nbsp; I cannot even write this without crying.&nbsp; He is incredible.&nbsp; And faithful.&nbsp; And THERE IS NO GREATER JOY THAN PLEASING GOD.</p><p>God continually reminds me that I do not need to seek admiration from people, because His love for me is more precious and more fulfilling than anything else ever will be.&nbsp;I have grown to be far more concerned with the beauty of my heart than with my outward appearance. And God is the reason I am becoming beautiful within.</p><p>“Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.” Proverbs 31:30</p><p>My friend, I wrote this for you. Someone needs to hear my story. I bared my soul so that you could have hope.&nbsp; Whatever it is that you are holding onto, that thing that gives you pleasure but that you know is wrong… you will never experience the fullness of joy until you surrender it to Jesus.&nbsp; Don’t make Him send a little squirrel to set you straight, friend!! Get on your knees and ask Him to help you.&nbsp; Ask Him to show you what you need to do, and then go all in.&nbsp; Give up whatever you’re holding onto.&nbsp; Then tell a godly friend about it.&nbsp; Get someone to pray for you.&nbsp; And then learn to fight your daily battle against that temptation until you can say you are free!&nbsp;</p><p>John 8:32 “Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong><em>A Word From Christi’s Husband</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christi came to me the other night and asked if I would read this blog and give it my “ok” since it involved me. After reading it I would not dare change one word of it. It was difficult for me when Christi first shared her struggle with me. I felt betrayed. I felt stupid. I felt as though all of the love and support I had given her had somehow not been enough. It was a hard thing to hear. It did take me a few days of thought and prayer but then I realized, it was a much harder thing for her to say than it was for me to hear. For her to come to me and be honest, to confess a struggle in her life that she knew would hurt me, THAT is hard.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems like hearing this kind of information would make someone jealous and suspicious, and I was at first. But, as I watched her ferociously seek God and draw her strength from Him to overcome this, I totally admired her. It seems like this is something that would destroy trust in a relationship. But in the long run I have gained so much trust in my wife. I know that she loves me and trusts me enough to be honest with me, even when it hurts. The way that her faith and commitment to God have grown over the last couple of years has been amazing. Facing this struggle in her life and walking through it with God has given her an amazing heart of compassion for people who are struggling. She is doing some amazing things in the lives of others (not the least of which is this blog). I am not sure any of that would have been possible without her being willing to face this struggle in her life. I do not have words to express how proud I am of my wife. I love her more everyday.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The joy on her face says it all.</p><p>Her sweet mama watches from the sidelines. Seeing the joy on her little girl’s face brings tears to Mom’s eyes. How precious is this kind of love. She looks at her daughter in awe.</p><p>True story. A friend of mine told me this last week. The joy on her little girl’s face while she was playing soccer brought tears to my friend’s eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>And the next morning, as I was praying, I remembered how my friend was so overcome with love and pride for her daughter. And suddenly, I felt God telling me, “That’s how I feel about you. I look at you and see the joy on your face when you encourage people and when you’re writing, and it brings tears to my eyes. I love you that much. You are that precious. You bring me so much joy. I delight in you, Christi.”</p><p>And with that, I just laid my head down on the table and cried. Because His love is so good that I can barely comprehend it.&nbsp;</p><p>“How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!” –1 John 3:1-</p><p>Did you know He loves you that way? He looks upon you and is overcome with love, pride, delight, and joy. You are His child. If you haven’t felt that kind of love from the Lord, ask Him to show you. And be watchful, because He wants to pour love out upon you that will bring you to your knees. There aren’t enough words to describe the incredible beauty of His love for you. Here is one way the Bible describes it:</p><p>“And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, <em>to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge-</em> that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.” –Ephesians 3:17b-19-</p><p>He loves you so. I pray you may experience the fullness of that love, my friends. May you come to know the depth of His love deep in your bones. It will change <em>everything</em>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

When He arrives, Martha rushes around working, preparing the food, no doubt with a desire to bless Jesus with a good meal and a nice environment.&nbsp; Mary, on the other hand, sits at the feet of Jesus, listening to His teaching.</p><p>Martha asks Jesus, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”</p><p>Here’s the important part.&nbsp; Don’t miss this.&nbsp; Jesus answers her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed.&nbsp; Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”</p><p>Did you catch that? “Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”&nbsp;</p><p>What is He talking about?&nbsp; He’s talking about spending time with Him.&nbsp; Listening.&nbsp; Seeking.&nbsp; Learning.&nbsp; Loving Him.&nbsp; CHOOSING to put Him above all else.&nbsp; Before the housework.&nbsp; Before the school clothes, homework, making dinner, packing lunches.&nbsp; Even before the kids, as demanding and urgent as their needs can be.&nbsp; Jesus says sitting at His feet and learning from Him is <em>better.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>So what does that mean for you and me?&nbsp; How do we “Choose What Is Better”?&nbsp; First of all, open your Bible, even if it’s for 10 minutes before the rest of the family gets up, or 10 minutes before you turn out your light at night.&nbsp; The Bible is the Word of God.&nbsp; There’s no better way to know who He is than to read His Word.&nbsp; It’s powerful!&nbsp; It will change you.</p><p>Secondly, talk to Him, friends.&nbsp; Pray.&nbsp; You can talk to Him all throughout the day, while you’re doing those thousand things on your To-Do list.&nbsp; But also, making some time for quiet prayer is very precious.&nbsp; Consider it like making a coffee date with a friend, but you’re meeting at your kitchen table with God while your family is asleep, just to pray.&nbsp; Set a time.&nbsp; Talk to Him.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t know how to talk to God yet, here are some simple tips:&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.5in">-Tell Him how much you love Him.&nbsp; Tell Him how amazing He is.&nbsp; It blesses His heart to hear it, and it reminds your heart just who your wonderful God is.&nbsp; He’s incredible!&nbsp; Don’t forget it!&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.5in">-Ask Him for help.&nbsp; Maybe there are physical needs, like money, recovery from illness, employment, etc.&nbsp; Ask Him for spiritual needs too.&nbsp; Patience, forgiveness, wisdom, kindness, courage, etc. And ask Him to help you make time to CHOOSE HIM.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.5in">-Ask Him to show you where you’ve messed up.&nbsp; Ask Him to bring to mind the sin in your life.&nbsp; We all have it. Because we aren’t perfect.&nbsp; Then tell Him you’re sorry for what You’ve done, and tell Him you will do your best not to do it again.&nbsp; And ask Him to help you!&nbsp; The Bible says that if you know Jesus Christ, His Holy Spirit goes with you as a Helper and Guide.&nbsp; He wants to help you avoid that sin next time!</p><p style="margin-left:.5in">-Ask Him to use you to do His good work in the lives of others.&nbsp; I recently heard this by author and Bible teacher Beth Moore: “Christians are meant to be profoundly effective.”&nbsp; If that doesn’t sound like you, ask Him for help in knowing how to be used by Him.&nbsp; He has created you to love Him and to love others and to accomplish many things for His glory.&nbsp; Ask Him for guidance and courage to do those things!</p><p style="margin-left:.5in">-And for Heaven’s sake, don’t forget to thank Him!&nbsp; Every bit of good in your life is a gift from God.&nbsp; And the hurtful, broken parts of life are still used by Him for beauty and good, if you let Him work in you.&nbsp; So thank Him!&nbsp; He has given you a thousand blessings, the main one being His Son Jesus, who died for you.&nbsp; I’ll say it again, thank Him!</p><p>OK, so I mentioned reading your Bible and talking to God, but what else? “Choosing What Is Better” also means seeking godly instruction.&nbsp; Attend church.&nbsp; Go to a Bible study.&nbsp; Read a devotional book. Listen to a sermon online or on the radio. CHOOSE HIM.&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe some of you are sitting there thinking, “Read the Bible? Go to church? Ain’t nobody got time for that!!” I hear ya.&nbsp; But look at Mary and Martha.&nbsp; There’s no question that there was work to be accomplished.&nbsp; But Mary CHOSE to set aside the work.&nbsp; To sit with her Lord.&nbsp; She knew that there is nothing more precious than time with Jesus.&nbsp; And did you catch that Jesus included a promise with Mary’s choice? “Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”&nbsp; When you offer God your time, to learn from Him, it will not be taken from you.&nbsp; Your heart will be shaped by Him.&nbsp; Forever.&nbsp; Every time you encounter Him, you are changed.&nbsp; For the better.&nbsp; I don’t think the dishes and laundry can offer you that same promise.&nbsp; So CHOOSE HIM.&nbsp; Make the time.&nbsp; Even if it’s brief.&nbsp; Jesus says it will not be taken away from you.&nbsp;</p><p>Recap:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Read your Bible.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Talk to God.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Seek godly instruction, i.e. church, Bible study, radio sermons, etc.</p><p>My house is a mess this morning.&nbsp; It was a crazy weekend, and there are dishes all over and laundry piles and a dirty bathroom.&nbsp; And today is my only day off from work, so I feel this pressure that all the chores need to get done <em>today</em>!&nbsp; And even if I work all day, it still won’t get done, so get going, Christi!! But…</p><p>Before I start all those things, I’m going to do my Bible study. And spend some time learning from Him and talking to Him.&nbsp; Because I want Jesus to look upon me and say, “She has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”&nbsp;-Luke 10:38-42</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

But….sometimes we need to try really hard to think about the good things in our life instead of the bad. I know it’s hard.”&nbsp; He didn’t see that I was quietly crying.&nbsp; Tears were dripping out of my eyes onto his pillow.&nbsp; Because the Holy Spirit had convicted me and taught me something right there in my son’s bedroom. “Christi, it hurts me when you are ungrateful.&nbsp; You have been given above and beyond all that you could ever need.&nbsp; And yet?&nbsp; Your perspective.&nbsp; You complain.”</p><p>When I left my son’s room, I folded his list and tucked it into the front of my Bible.&nbsp; To remind myself to stop making a List.&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; All the time.&nbsp; Complaints.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-I’m exhausted.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-I’m too busy.&nbsp;</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-I see carpet stains.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-Our house is too small.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-There isn’t enough money.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-There isn’t enough time.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-Everyone needs something from me.</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-This house is always messy.&nbsp;</em></p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>-And I’m supposed to have a good attitude?&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; Major fail.</em></p><p>In reality, when I stop the complaints and recognize the truth, I have more blessings than I can even name.&nbsp; But I’ve been stuck in this place of negativity.&nbsp; Ingratitude.</p><p>So what’s the solution??

He said that is how healthy attitudes in marriage work.&nbsp; You’ve got a WHOLE LOTTA complaints about your spouse.&nbsp; Because your spouse is an imperfect human being.&nbsp; But you do have the ability to shift your perspective and see the good qualities about your spouse instead of the complaints.&nbsp; Force your mind to see the box differently.&nbsp; See the marriage differently.&nbsp;</p><p>Heck.
