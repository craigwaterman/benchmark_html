<div class="storycontent">
<p>I recently had a conversation with one of my colleagues in Christian Educational Leadership and we were discussing our distinctiveness in education.  The question was, “What makes us different?”</p>
<p>He brought up the idea that what we do is really transformational.  The more I think about that term the more I like it.  In Christian education we have the ability to stand on the solid foundation of the Bible as our only rule for faith and practice.  Unlike other educational institutions, that base their values and morals on the social setting and context, we in Christian Education have a set of values that are unchanging and constant, as seen in God’s Word.</p>
<p>Take for example one of the basic teachings of the Bible, that we are all born in sin.  Romans 3:23 states, “For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.” Or Psalm 51:5 states, “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”</p>
<p>Where your belief system starts from makes all the difference in the world, as you develop an understanding of God and His creation.  If you begin with a concept that you are basically a good person and capable of finding your own way, you will have a far different perspective than a person who comes to an understanding that we are sinful from birth and we are in need of Christ&#8217;s redemptive act to lift us out of our sin.</p>
<p>In Christian Education we help our students form or transform their view of life through the lenses of scripture.  In Christian education we are about transforming our student’s view of who they are before God and how they can interact with our world in a transformational way.</p>
<p>So does this make a difference and is it worth all the effort and financial effort put forth in having your child attend Manhattan Christian?  If having you child in a system that is built on the solid foundation and the transforming word of God, I will let you draw your own conclusion.</p>
<p>Thanks for partnering with us in our transformational work.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It is the end of a long two week stretch at MCS. It has been a great two weeks! We prepared for and held staff in-service which is always time consuming and somewhat intense. It is challenging to make the time meaningful and useful to teachers,when all they want to do is get after it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On the evening of August 24</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;">,  we hosted our second annual “Back-to-School Night” and it was again, a huge success. We provided an opportunity for students and parents to find their lockers, visit the classrooms and teachers and get comfortable with their new surroundings. The elementary had about 98% of the students in attendance. The Middle School and High School divisions had a very high turn-out as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Tuesday, August 25 we opened the doors of the school and welcomed 278 students to a new school year. The first week was an overall success. Students, for the most part, seemed happy to be back and the staff was excited to begin a new year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We welcomed three new teachers to our staff:  Mr. Bellach as our Phys Ed. instructor, Miss Wesselius as our Spanish instructor, and Mrs. Daum as our Elementary Music teacher. We are excited to have them join the staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Athletics is up and running. Our girls’ volleyball team placed third in the annual Chauteau Tournament last weekend and  our boys who play football had their first game last Friday with a win over Anaconda. Our cross country teams for MS and HS will compete on Saturday in Twin Bridges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We are off and running the race. I pray we all have a great year. </span></p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>I have been negligent over the past several months in my postings on the blog. I apologize for that, however I have been struggling with content that should be posted on such a place as this.</p>
<p>Each week, I write articles for the school Weekly and I also write articles for the monthly Connections. This often drains my creativity. I find it hard to pontificate with new and creative educational subjects like I read on other blogs, so I am going to go in another direction. You may receive some wisdom now and then from what I would like to do but I really thought that maybe people would enjoy knowing what has happened at school on a regular (weekly) basis.</p>
<p>So, what I will be doing is giving you a rundown of the things that have happened at school over the course of the week. You will need to understand that it will, of course, be filtered through the perspective of an administrator. My hope is that ultimately you will come to be encouraged that some truly great things are happening at MCS. Occasionally, you may receive a negative comment or two on something that happened but I would say that is also part of life at any school. I hope those will be truly limited.</p>
<p>Look for another post at the end of the week!</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Isaiah 64:8</p>
<p><em>“Yet, O Lord, you are our Father.</em></p>
<p><em>We are the clay, you are the potter;</em></p>
<p><em>We are all the work of your hands.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>As I wander up and down the halls, I am reminded daily of our theme for this year. There are bulletin boards that highlight this theme to help remind us of our focus. As we move through the year, however, I have often wondered how we are doing living out this theme.</p>
<p>From my perspective, I see evidences of some tremendous strides being made. Among student interactions, we see empathy and understanding being expressed to others. We see acceptance and true kindness and we see academic improvement and success. In extra-curricular areas, we see students demonstrating high levels of success and skill and we see students who have never even thought of trying anything like sports or music. Unfortunately, from my perspective, I also see some shortcomings. Sometimes students do not treat each other with kindness. Hurtful things are said. In some cases, a lack of understanding is demonstrated in the area of academics. Some students have not figured out that we are about “school” here at MCS. Education is our overall calling, but some are not on that page yet.</p>
<p>Through our successes and even in our failures, we will press on. God has places every educator and student at Manhattan Christian for a specific purpose and calling. The Bible reminds us of this fact in the book of Esther, chapter four. We are placed in particular situations for such a time as this. We will continue to try and mold and shape the young lives God has placed at MCS. We will celebrate the successes and try to pick up the pieces for those who fall short.</p>
<p>In this Christmas season, let us rejoice in the calling we have as parents, grandparents, and educators as we mold and shape young lives for service to Christ our King.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manhattan Christian inspires students to live God-glorifying lives by teaching Christ&#8217;s Lordship in faith, learning, and living.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portrait of a Graduate</p>
<p>It is our goal that our graduates will:</p>
<ul>
<li>practice godly discernment;</li>
<li>sacrifice themselves as servant leaders;</li>
<li>dare to think deeply and take action;</li>
<li>walk humbly in Christ&#8217;s footsteps with obedience and joy; and</li>
<li>create a thankful response to our Savior.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Christian Education, you will probably never see a mission statement that does not include some statements about preparing students for life. Our mission and portrait of a graduate are not different. As educators, we play a huge role in this process. However, our role does not overshadow the role and responsibilities of our parents. Ultimately, parents are responsible to God for how they have helped their children develop into servants of God.</p>
<p>I once had a staff member tell me that parents generally fall into one of two categories. One type of parent is the parent who prepares the road for the students, and the second type of parent is a parent who prepares their student for the road. This thought has never left me.</p>
<p>Parents who use the preparation of the road method for child development tend to continually move in front of the student attempting to make the road as smooth as possible so that there are relatively few bumps along the way. If you will, these parents take on a roll of road graders, always smoothing out the road. There are excuses, interventions, or explanations for almost every situation students find themselves in. Consequences for action are thought to e unfair, harsh, or my favorite, lacking grace. In general, there is little accountability expected from the child. The parent believes or is manipulated into believing that their child is basically faultless in most situations, and they look to displace the blame. This system may work for awhile, but eventually, the student has to leave the cover and protection of mom and dad. As the student leaves home, life begins to move at a quicker pace and no one is there to prepare the road. In general, the ruts, bumps, pot holes, and hard life lessons happen at a time in life when the consequences can be severe and very long lasting. The child winds up not knowing how to deal with the struggles of life because they have never had to do so before. Someone else did it for them.</p>
<p>The other method of child rearing is one that recognizes that the student needs to be prepared for the road. The parent recognizes the need to have built in their child the confidence, coping skills and discernment that enable them to make reasonable and responsible choices or decisions. The student prep approach recognizes that not all bumps and pot holes are avoidable and that it is impossible to maintain a smooth road. In fact, it is healthy and beneficial for the child to understand that consequences for actions are a reality. In short, this parent spends time preparing the student for the road. They spend time guiding and instructing the child on how to avoid pot holes and helps them deal with disappointments and the rough road of life that will be there.</p>
<p>The life of a mature individual is always going to include some obstacles to deal with. James 1 assures us that trials will come into our lives. We need to understand that and be able to deal with it when it happens.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.&#8221; James 1:2-4</em></p>
<p>If we continually prepare the road for the student, they will not know what to do when no one is there to prepare the road for them. As educators, our job is to partner with parents in preparing our students for the road. When on of the partners is striving to prepare the child for the road and the other partner simply takes on the task of making sure the road is smooth, the end product will be in doubt. Preparing children to face the trials of life is not an easy task. At times, it is painful to watch your child struggle, but in the long run it will pay off for the child and the parent.</p>
<p>So the question is this: &#8220;What type of parent are you or do you want to be? Are you preparing your child for the road or are you preparing the road for your child?&#8221;</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p><a href="https://manhattanchristian.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/harvest-festival-poster-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-464" src="https://manhattanchristian.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/harvest-festival-poster-2.jpg?w=194&#038;h=300" alt="Harvest Festival Poster 2" width="194" height="300" /></a>Well, the tension is mounting and there are a large number of people coming in and out of school today. The HARVEST FESTIVAL is tomorrow and it appears that God is going to bless our event with some great weather. This fact, for me, is just another example of how God blesses Manhattan Christian School.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning we are going to kick-off the day with a new event. The &#8220;Harvest Hustle&#8221; will be a 5k run/walk event. To date, we have more than 50 pre-registered participants. There will be plenty of food booths and a wonderful lunch opportunity for those who attend. There is a craft room, Christmas gifts, a recycled treasures room full of used items, a book room, and of course, the all time favorite for kids, a huge game area.</p>
<p>This is a huge community building event for MCS. It is great to see the community gather to support the school through personal and financial contributions and also come and connect with other parents who send their children to MCS.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all of those who have taken on leadership roles in putting this event together. The time and effort is much appreciated and it is certainly a huge benefit to the school community. To all the worker bees, we also say a huge thank you. Without the participation of volunteers, community events like the Harvest Festival would not be possible.</p>
<p>God bless you all.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>This weekend is a very important week for Manhattan Christian School. The Harvest Festival is not only an important fundraiser for the school, but it is also an important community builder.</p>
<p>The school becomes a gathering point for families all across all grades levels. There are fun events for people to participate in throughout the day. There is always plenty of great food. The pies that are homemade and available for purchase by the slice or as a whole pie are one of the favorites. There are also dutch treats and treasures abound.</p>
<p>Besides the outdoor auction that begins at about 10:00am, there will be a new event added this year. The Harvest Hustle is a 5k running event. Our dream is to expand this into a 10k as well, but we are starting out on a smaller scale in order to test our our system. The annual Fun Run will also be held for the younger crowd at 9:00am.</p>
<p>All of the monies brought in through this event go directly to our MCS Friends Committee&#8217;s commitment to raise money for the General Fund of the school. All families who participate in the Community Grant Program or receive a multiple-student discount benefit financially from this event.</p>
<p>I encourage each and every family to take a portion of your day on Saturday, October 25th and come on down to MCS. You are sure to have a good time. Come get to know the school and each other a little bit better. Becoming part of a greater whole is an important thing in the life of your family.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>We are four weeks into the school year and we are in the middle of Homecoming Week. The students are pretty much in the groove of routine and being back in the classroom.</p>
<p>This week we have homecoming festivities. The high school students are building floats at various locations with the help of parents. On Thursday night they will be finishing up. I am sure it will be a long night for the students and staff. The Homecoming parade in Churchill will be held on Friday at 2:00 PM. This is always a highlight for the elementary students especially.</p>
<p>Throughout the week we are having dress up days; Monday was Duct Tape Day. It was amazing how creative some of the kids can be when given the opportunity. On Tuesday, it was really a bad hair day around the school. It was also a throwback day with Decade Day. I think Mrs. Swanson took the grand prize with the hippy look from the 70s. Wednesday is Movie Character Day and the kids are certainly in rare form. From Toy Story to Pippi Long Stocking and Steve Urkel, the students are so creative. On Thursday, we will have Superhero Day and Friday we will have the traditional Spirit Day.</p>
<p>These types of activities and events are what help make MCS a unique and fun place to attend for our students. In having these types of activities, memories are built and school pride and spirit is grown and developed. Some of my fondest memories from high school are the activities that went on during homecoming and other fun events. All of this builds community and a sense of being.</p>
<p>What Fun!</p>

<h2 class="storytitle" id="post-458"><a href="https://manhattanchristian.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/christian-education-funds/" rel="bookmark">Christian Education Funds</a></h2>


<div class="storycontent">
<p>As many of you know, the CRC churches in the valley strongly support the covenant concept of Christian Education. From a theological standpoint, the CRC church has, in the founding denominational documents, the requirement that the church is to ensure that a Christian school is to be supported in the communities where the CRC churches are present. In the Gallatin Valley, the churches have taken this very seriously and soon after the formal formation of the churches in the valley, they began Manhattan Christian School. The theological basis lies in the imperative statements in scripture that tell parents that they are responsible for the Godly instruction of their children. Since most parents do not have the time or the ability to conduct schooling themselves, this has lead to the formation of Christian schools with a Calvinistic perspective all over the United States. </p>
<p>In the valley, our churches have chosen to take that one step further and provide a direct financial commitment to the parents of children who enroll at MCS. The Christian Education funds are set up to provide an avenue for community support of those who may need some assistance. The church actually pays the tuition for each child enrolled at MCS through the Christian Education Fund. Parents are expected to support the fund and pay their fair share into the fund, but if someone needs some help, it is there. This is the perfect picture of covenant theology working its way through financial support. </p>
<p>However, it does not end there. The church continues to lead and guide the youth of today into becoming fully devoted kingdom citizens through the various church-related programs. </p>
<p>What a joy it is to be part of a community that is so fully devoted to the concept and purpose of Christian education! At times, it may not be easy to see past the financial commitments that are part of this endeavor. However, when you see the results that have been demonstrated in the 4th and 5th generations of students who have been educated at MCS, I stand amazed and thankful to God.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>The first day of school has finally arrived. We opened the doors at 8:00 AM and students began arriving. We are excited for the coming year. While we have lost a few families from last year, we are excited because we have 37 new students this year. </p>
<p>At 8:30 AM, we had our opening Convocation with a welcome presented by Mr. Jason Kimm, Board President. Mr. De Jong spoke to the students, parents, and staff about God as the creator and sustainer and that He is the potter working on forming us into useful vessels for service to Him. </p>
<p>God has certainly blessed us and has been with us over the summer months. We have accomplished several major facility upgrades and have several others in the works. We filled all available positions before the start of school and have welcomed five part-time people on to staff. I will post more on that at a later date. </p>
<p>Athletics are up and running with record numbers showing up for Volleyball and Cross Country. Things are looking up for the future. Several new athletes have joined us this year. </p>
<p>Plans are well underway for the upcoming Harvest Festival to be held on October 25th. One new event connected with the Harvest Festival will be a 5k or 10k running event. Details will be coming out soon. </p>
<p>Like I said, We are off and running! </p>
