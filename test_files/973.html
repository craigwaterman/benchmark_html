<p>Have you ever had a good fail, big or small, just an all-out fail? I had one just last week. What amazed me with this particular fail was that while it was such an ordinary situation, something it seemed like I’d done many times before, this time was different.</p>
<p>You might laugh at how trivial my fail sounds. I’ll be the first to admit that while it wasn’t a life altering fail, it was one that gave me clear reminders about life.</p>
<p>So what was my fail? Here goes…  A few weeks ago, I started a gluten free diet. Almost immediately I was out of town for a work conference. Every meal time and break time served as a reminder of everything I couldn’t have.  After that initial challenging time of adjustment, I just wanted to sink my teeth into a real treat, not one that tasted “modified.”</p>
<p>I pulled out my best Toll House Cookie recipe and began to whip up what I anticipated being the most amazing chocolate chip cookies ever. I made the appropriate substitutions based on my new eating plan, put the cookies in the oven and waited. The sweet aroma of the baking cookies soon filled my kitchen fueling my anticipation. When the timer rang, I opened the oven door surprised by what I found.</p>
<p>The cookies had completely lost their form and were one giant melted mess not much thicker than the aluminum foil that they now appeared to be one with. The “cookies” were so thin, I couldn’t pick any portion, even with a spatula. In fact, the only way I could remove them from the sheet was to use a spatula to squeegee the sheet. I proceeded to drop the shapeless goo into a square storage container, and promptly walked away from it, defeated.</p>
<p>My cookie fiasco reminded me of the many ways it looks like when we have a “fail” in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>My situation didn’t resemble anything at all like I set out to achieve.</li>
<li>It looked completely and utterly unsalvageable.</li>
<li>Our fails often blindside us, where we least expect to find them.</li>
<li>It left me feeling disappointed, discouraged, and defeated.</li>
<li>And, sometimes when we have a big fail, we feel just like my cookie goo – like we’re no more than a puddle of our former selves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine my surprise when the next day I lifted the lid to the container and found my “goo” had solidified into a cookie bar consistency. It was actually quite good! In fact, I will make my squeegeed goo bars again!</p>
<p>As I enjoyed my cookie bar, I realized that I was given a few valuable reminders that can apply across life’s many disappointments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our situations can appear unsalvageable.</li>
<li>Our despair or disappointment can be immeasurable.</li>
<li>We can feel as though there’s no hope.</li>
<li>But, when we scoop ourselves up, even if we’re an unrecognizable mess, and place ourselves and our troubles into the best possible container of all, God’s hands, we’re reformed into something new, something even better, something we never saw coming.</li>
<li>Our reward is sweet, success replaces failure, hope replaces despair, and a promising path replaces a dead end.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed,</em><em> </em><em>for his compassions never fail.</em><em>They are new every morning;</em><em> </em><em>great is your faithfulness.</em><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong><em>I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion;</em><em> </em><em>therefore I will wait for him.”</em> Lam 3:22-24 NIV</p>
<p>I’m happy to say that since experiencing my awful goo failure I’ve adjusted the recipe and have made some amazing gluten free cookies. I do have to say, I’m kind of glad they didn’t come out the first time…. I’d rather have this reminder and great perspective on life’s failures. And, now I have a great cookie recipe and I’m pretty sure I invented the squeegee cookie bar.</p>
<p>Did my cookie mess remind you of any lessons failure has taught you? Or, has it given you a much needed perspective shift? I’d love to hear what you think! Join the conversation.</p>

<p>What if you had the opportunity for a free gift that could improve your productivity, increase your happiness, improve your health, help you deepen your faith, and help you make progress towards personal growth? Who wouldn’t want something that could do all that?</p>
<p>What could possibly do all those things? Drum roll please… it’s the fall time change. This coming weekend when most of us will turn our clocks back an hour, you have an important choice to make. Will you simply sleep an extra hour on Sunday morning and that be the entire “gain” of the extra hour, or will you allow that one hour to provide compounded returns that will last for months to come?</p>
<p>How do you do that? Next Sunday, get up when your body nudges you to do so, an hour earlier &#8211; when you would have before the change. The first morning it will feel almost natural. Resist any urge to hit the snooze. You can harness that extra hour to propel you towards personal growth and goals that have previously felt out of reach. Motivational speakers have long spoke of the power of extra time in the early hours of the morning. The fall time change is a gift that comes just once a year that makes such a change seem natural.</p>
<p><em>“The difference between rising at five and seven o’clock in the morning, for forty years, supposing a man to go to bed at the same hour at night, is nearly equivalent to the addition of ten years to a man’s life.” </em><em>~Philip Doddridge</em></p>
<p>Not convinced yet? In Michael Hyatt’s podcast “<a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/028-reengineer-your-morning-ritual.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reengineer Your Morning Ritual</span></a>,” Michael shares that “Morning people tend to make more money, be more productive, be healthier and live longer, and be more happy and satisfied in their lives.”</p>
<p>How can you make this happen?</p>
<p>1. <strong>Pick your priorities</strong> – What do you what to do with the time? What have you wished you could do but just haven’t found enough time? A few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Learn/ study a skill</li>
<li>Write a blog or a book</li>
<li>Pray, read your Bible, read a Bible Study</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>2. <strong>Set your alarm</strong> and get up starting Sunday. Warning: If you wait to adopt your new schedule, it will get <strong>much harder </strong>to implement with each additional day you delay.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Stick to it!</strong> Keep to your new schedule in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Have a plan.</strong> When you go to bed, know what you want to accomplish with your extra hour in the morning. Maybe you’ll plan to exercise on certain days of the week but use the other days for a different goal.</p>
<p><strong>5. Write it down.</strong> On a sticky note, index card or small piece of paper write down why you want to do this. Put it next to your alarm clock as an important reminder, a snooze deterrent.</p>
<p><strong>6. Tell a friend.</strong> Share this idea with your friends. Maybe one or more of them will adopt this too. You can encourage each other to stay the course and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>A few facts about mornings to encourage you:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re less likely to be pulled off track by distractions in the morning. Your phone and email are quiet and your family is still asleep.</li>
<li>Your willpower is stronger in the morning. Your energy hasn’t been reduced by all the day’s activities.</li>
<li><em>“Morning is an important time of day, because how you spend your morning can often tell you what kind of day you are going to have.”~ Lemony Snicket</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So who’s in? I know I am. I&#8217;ll be splitting the mornings working on specific goals on the same day each week. Some of the days I&#8217;ll definitely be working on my next book!</p>
<p>Will you invest your “extra hour” in your progress? If so, what will you do with your extra time each morning? Join the conversation… I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Have you ever felt a bit overwhelmed? Like life’s dealt you a card that you’d rather not have in your hand? Life has a way of periodically doing that, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>In the past few weeks I’ve found myself feeling exactly that way. I felt like my already full plate didn’t need one more thing. My “one more thing” was a shift requiring me to change to a gluten free diet. Overnight my choices needed to change. Challenged to rethink my everyday food choices, I was reminded of how I’ve successfully faced other mountains in my life. Maybe these tips can help you the next time life throws you a curve ball.</p>
<p><strong>Resist the urge to focus on the entire mountain all at once.</strong> Sometimes it’s easy to want to solve the “whole thing” whatever it is in one fell swoop. I’m reminded about the Couch to 5K training program that so many people use. When we face a problem, we want to reach the finish line overnight. But just as that program starts a person slowly running in very short bursts, the consistency of taking the steps leads to achieving a goal of running a 5K that once seemed impossible. I can be freed knowing that I don’t need to become a gluten free master chef overnight. Instead I need to focus on one meal, on choice at a time. The same is true for you and whatever you’re facing.</p>
<p><strong>Resist the urge to focus on the “bark.”</strong>  Equally paralyzing to progress, we can get caught over analyzing the minutia. Don’t get so lost in the details that you only see bark and don’t even recognize trees or the entire forest. We can over google our symptoms. We can over research our challenge. Step away from the internet! Find a balance of being informed but still living day to day life.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on what you can do, not on what you can’t do. </strong>I have to give credit where credit is due. This was a reminder from my son Ryan last week. I found myself listing all the things I couldn’t eat. We can get so stuck focusing on the limits we have, we forget all the possibilities we have. What can you do? For me it was ‘what can I still eat?’ Brain storm a list, write it down, and focus on your possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Start. </strong>You have to start a race to win it. You have to start up the mountain to reach the summit. Whatever you’re delaying doing, just do it. Start. Jon Acuff says it so well, “You don&#8217;t need to go back in time to be awesome; you just have to start right now.”</p>
<p><strong>Take reasonable incremental steps. </strong>Once you’ve listed what you can do, and you’ve started, keep going! Take one step after another. Resist the urge to make your journey harder than it needs to be. Take incremental steps. Even baby steps in the right direction are bringing you closer to where you want to be. My incremental steps were finding a few go to meals and snacks. Pinterest has be wonderful in giving me ideas&#8230; maybe it’s a source for whatever you’re facing too. Whatever the challenge, keep going!</p>
<p>If you’re faced with a mountain, my hope is that these tips will help. Friend, please know that you aren’t alone not matter what you face!</p>

<p>I only looked away for a second. What could go wrong?. Standing at the stove in my quaint little kitchen I was in the familiar, the safely of my home. I’d stood in this exact spot so many times before that on any other day, it would have gone unremembered. But I didn’t  notice the dish towel on the counter, the one that must have caught on my arm when I turned pulling it across the hot stove. Woosh… a flash of heat, a wall of flames seemingly out of nowhere. From comfortable to crisis in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Had you been standing near me you would have screamed <strong>Stop! Fire!</strong> Most definitely, you’d have come to my rescue without even thinking. <strong>Your response would have been as instantaneous as the fire.</strong></p>
<p>When problems in life flare up so suddenly, they grab our attention. They propel us to immediate action. We wouldn’t think of delaying even for a moment. Yet I want to share with you a danger that is equally gripping. So dangerous it threatens<strong> 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men.</strong> Just like fire, it destroys, it scars, and it kills. But unlike the fictitious fire I shared at the beginning of this blog, it’s a very real danger. Very real.</p>
<p>It’s a danger that simmers. It masks itself as caring, generosity, and love but behind closed doors it destroys. October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. You may not be in an abusive relationship but <strong>75% of all Americans know someone</strong> who is or has been. Please take a few moments and read on. The information I share may save the life of someone close to you.</p>
<p>Abuse doesn’t start with a flash. There’s no immediate “flame.” It rarely starts with something as obvious as physical contact such as a slap or punch. So then how does someone find themselves in the grips of abuse? They don’t recognize the traits of an abusive partner. What can you look for?</p>
<p><strong>5 common traits of an abusive partner.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>They’re Intense.</strong> – They get serious quickly. They may talk about marriage unnaturally early in the relationship. They’re excessively generous, exude charm and charisma. They may shower you or others with elaborate gifts which are over the top or inappropriately expensive. They’re often well liked or popular and command the attention of others. They call or text with great frequency. If you don’t answer or respond immediately, they call repeatedly. Even if they know you’re busy, the barrage continues until you respond. In the beginning it seems like caring, but it’s obsessive in the name of “making sure you are ok.” They want to be your oxygen and want you to be theirs.</li>
<li><strong>They’re jealous.</strong> &#8211; In the beginning, they justify their jealousy as love. Once in the relationship, they repeatedly accuse you of being unfaithful without cause. They’re irrationally jealous of any time you spend with family, friends, and especially the opposite sex. They monitor your Facebook page, may demand your social media or email passwords. They check your phone activity monitoring who you speak to while questioning what you do or say with other people. And often they blame your  behavior for their jealousy. If you didn&#8217;t &#8230; they wouldn&#8217;t be so jealous.</li>
<li><strong>They’re critical.</strong> – The same individual who is over the top generous with their words and actions also insults you and tears you down. You’re stupid, useless, a bad parent. No one could ever love you the way they do. If you have children, they assure you that the court would never allow you to raise your children should you separate. They attempt to convince you that you’ve been successful because of them. They’ve made you who you are and you couldn’t survive on your own.</li>
<li><strong>They control.</strong> – They influence most aspects of your life – how you spend your time, who you spend it with, what you wear, how you wear your hair etc. In the beginning they position it as &#8220;caring about you.&#8221;They show up at your work or home when you’re not expecting them. If you’re out with friends, they may show up uninvited. They may say it&#8217;s just because they missed you but in reality, they&#8217;re monitoring you. They may ask or tell you to unfriend friends on social media, or worse they&#8217;ll log into your account and unfriend them for you. They may force you to do things you do not want to do, sexually or otherwise to prove you love them.</li>
<li><strong>They isolate.</strong> – Your circle of friends and family dwindles, eventually shrinking to nearly non-existent. They become your constant. They insist you spend as much time together as possible. In the beginning, it may almost seem appealing. You translate the exclusivity of time as “true love.” But instead of a healthy nurturing love, it’s a suffocating, isolating, dependency building behavior. Has your circle of friends declined sharply since beginning the relationship? If so assess why. The isolation typically involved with abuse makes breaking free harder. Harder but not impossible. Getting free is possible if you get help.</li>
</ol>
<p>Abuse may start with traits like these, initially perhaps subtly and then growing in intensity. A partner does not need to exhibit all of these to be abusive. Even one can be a symptom that something is very wrong. What should you do if you recognize these traits in your partner or in a friend’s relationship?</p>
<ul>
<li>Take it seriously! Do not ignore that feeling that something isn’t right.</li>
<li>Speak up. If it’s a friend in danger, talk to them with genuine empathy. Just like you wouldn’t have allowed me to stand next to the stove with a flash fire, help your friend to see the real danger.</li>
<li>Share this blog and resources with your friends and family. 1 in 4 women are affected by abuse and need to know they are not alone!</li>
<li>Domestic violence escalates. A life can depend on the action taken. Don&#8217;t ignore it. Get help: <a title="www.thehotline.org" href="http://www.thehotline.org/">www.thehotline.org</a>.</li>

<p>Ah, I just don’t have time to get to that… When I have a free weekend, when this semester is over, when our schedule isn’t so packed….Those were just a few of my excuses I used for far too long for not tackling a few unruly closets in our house, not to mention some boxes still in the garage from when we moved here.</p>
<p>Can you relate? As I’ve diligently begun to tackle some of the spaces over the past few weeks, I’ve realized I’m not the only one who struggles with this.  So why declutter? There are lots of reasons. Here are just a few…</p>
<p><strong>10 Reasons to Declutter:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It frees up energy to focus on the important stuff. You’re no longer distracted by the clutter.</li>
<li>It helps free you from the past. What do you need to let go of? Clutter can cause us to carry things from the past that we’re not intended to hold on to.</li>
<li>Declutterig give you a fresh outlook and gives space for your next chapter.</li>
<li>It allows you to appreciate what you have in the present.</li>
<li>Decluttering saves money because you don’t buy what you already have.</li>
<li>You’ll spend less time cleaning and spend more time enjoying what you have. Decluttering can reduce housework by up to 40%. Who doesn’t want to reduce their housework?</li>
<li>Each time you do it, it gets easier. Really, the more you do it the easier it is.</li>
<li>Decluttering reduces stress.</li>
<li>Someone else might really need what you have and don’t use.</li>
<li>It is liberating! When you declutter you instantly feel a million pounds lighter. Why is it so freeing? Because clutter can weigh us down emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically. Clutter even steels our time. Let go and be free!</li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge… it seems so overwhelming! Where can you start? Here a few ideas I’ve used as I’ve tackled clutter at our home:</p>
<p><strong>Tackle it in small doses.</strong> Pick a number and say each day I’m going to mindfully deal with 5 things. You can even nickname the effort – “Strive for Five.” Each day look around and decide on your five things and deal with them. They can be big or small. The idea with this approach is to be consistent. You’ll be amazed how the small but consistent approach adds up. And, you don’t need to wait for a Saturday to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Lose it or lose it.</strong> Do you have more than one size in your closet? First ask yourself, if you lost that nagging 15 pounds, would you rush to wear that or not. Get rid of things you can objectively say even if it fit, you probably wouldn’t wear it. Put everything that you want to keep and doesn’t fit into a box. Give yourself a healthy weight loss goal for the next month as an example I’ll say 4 pounds. At the end of the month, if you haven’t achieved that loss, donate 3 or more things from your “skinny” box. Remember these are the clothes you hope to wear again. You need to lose it, or you lose it. If you aren’t making progress towards wearing them again, it makes sense to thin out that stash of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Set a timer.</strong> Pick a window of time and stay focused until the timer rings. You’ll be amazed how much you can do in a 30 minute or hour sprint. Defining the start and end time increases productivity. When the timer rings, take a short break and then “sprint” again until you’ve exhausted the time you’ve set aside. You’ll be surprised how quickly you can work through a closet this way.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate the value.</strong> Ask yourself a few clarifying questions – Does the item have sentimental value? If not, if you saw this in a store, would I buy it? How much would I pay for it? If you wouldn’t buy it or wouldn’t be willing to pay much for it, why are you keeping it? We tend to tell ourselves that what we have has value rather than evaluating if it has value and then deciding if we should keep it based on how we answer that. Ask yourself, how do I feel when I wear it? Believe it or not I’ve found things in my closet that I don’t like how they make me feel. Maybe the fabric isn’t comfortable or the color isn’t quite right for me. Why keep something that you don’t feel great in?</p>
<p><strong>Pray about it</strong>. It may sound silly, or you might feel like your clutter is far too small an issue to trouble God with. The truth of the matter is God is a God of order so who better to ask for help? You might just be surprised how He’ll meet you right where you are.</p>
<p>How have you tackled decluttering? What works for you? Have you found other benefits to decluttering? As the colder days settle in, I’m motivated to make my way through all of our closets and the garage too. I’m finding the progress empowering and it really has freed me to focus on things like my writing. How does decluttering free you? I’d love to hear from you.</p>
