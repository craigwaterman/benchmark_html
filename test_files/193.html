<h2><a title="2009 &#8211; The Year of the Robot" href="http://geargab.kingwho.com/?p=305" rel="bookmark">2009 &#8211; The Year of the Robot</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://www.gizoo.co.uk/Products/PcGaming/Wireless/Nabaztag/Additional/lrg-3-Nabaztag_Tag.jpg" alt="Nabaztag" width="200" /></p>
<p>I'm going to skip 2008 and go right to my 2009 prediction. 2009 will be the year of the robot!</p>
<p>We first started seeing robots enter our day-to-day world with toy devices such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIBO">Sony's AIBO</a> or your <a href="http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html">Robosapien</a>. Then we started seeing working robots like the <a href="http://irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=122">iRobot Roomba</a> vacuum cleaner. This year we were introduced to the <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag/tag</a> wi-fi bunny that was connected to you network and not only entertains you but also reads you your email and RSS feeds.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.robocommunity.com/imagelib/contentitem/12414/f0f219158e118e83-2f5677fd-11757492c08--49f4492335409.jpg" alt="Rovio from WowWee" /></p>
<p>At this year's CES we are seeing the next step in robot technology. <a href="http://www.wowwee.com/">WowWee</a> the maker of the Robosapien, Roboraptor and anything else you can put Robo in front of has a new "security" product. Rovio is their newly announced roving webcam that you can control from a webpage and view what is going on in your office or home. You can also setup a predefined area that the Rovio can patrol. I'm not sure what makes this a security product, but I do see a use for it.</p>
<p><img src="http://irbt.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pIROBOT1-4102402dt.jpg" alt="iRobot's Looj" width="200" /></p>
<p><a href="http://irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=95">iRobot</a> who makes the Roomba and other home cleaning products also makes industrial and military robots. They have announced there new <a href="http://irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=354">Looj</a>, a gutter cleaning robot that crawls through the leaves and slime to leave your gutters clean and ready for rain and snow.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag</a> which is made by French company Violet, is built on an platform that gives enterprising developers the ability to connect in and create their own applications for this device. The bunny allows for user to input via voice, button or RFID tag, although they don't quite have the RFID features ready for prime time.</p>
<p>As of today most of the Nabaztag add ons from developers that have made entertainment applications such as radio and podcast streaming, but the possibilities are endless. Universities in Europe, where the device has been available for quite some time, have been developing anything from diet/nutrition studies to medication alert systems.</p>
<p>iRobot also has <a href="http://irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=289">opensource development models</a> available to the public. The company provides the basic communication to the device and you can add to it.</p>
<p>Having working products that allow developers to add on to them creates huge push for the future of the technology. Before enterprising robot developers not only had to deal with their own code but also be an expert in the robot they were developing on. Developing add ons for the Nabaztag or iRobot is no different than developing add ons for Facebook or Google.</p>
<p>My immediate thoughts on where some of these technologies could go is for people who have elderly parents or neighbors they could use the security robot to check in on them. The Nabaztag could be used to make sure they are taking their medication when they should.</p>
<p>Robots are here and the floodgates are about to open. They might not exactly look like a robots of the 1950's but they are tools that will start to change how we go about our day to day lives.</p>
<hr />. . . I just wanted to note for this article that my family owns a Nabaztag. It is hilarious interacting with a bunny on a day to day basis. Right now it is a novelty and doesn't really add to the quality of our lives, but I bet it happens soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>By now you can figure out that I impulse shop. I saw<br />
these cool toys and I had to buy. They are by far the best<br />
made action figures that I have seen. This should come<br />
as no surprise to anyone who has ever bought any Todd<br />
McFarlane toys before. He is the creator of Spawn comics<br />
and has made toys for many things including Ozzy, Kiss,<br />
Austin Powers and Spawn.</p>
<p>Of course I am no collector, so I immediately took them out<br />
of the box and began to play. Screw collecting, have fun.</p>

<p>I have had a Palm Pilot for some time now<br />

date book, song lyric, web addresses<br />

<p>That said, the things just aren't much<br />
fun.</p>
<p>Enter the Handspring Visor. This puppy<br />
looks like it might have the tools I've<br />
been waiting for. I've have always wanted<br />
to talk into the box to record notes, melodies<br />
or new swear words. I would like to make<br />
a phone call, or even play an MP3. I will<br />
try one the minute I can get it, so stay tuned.</p>

<h2><a title="Issue #6 : The Long Overdue Issue" href="http://geargab.kingwho.com/?p=13" rel="bookmark">Issue #6 : The Long Overdue Issue</a></h2>
<p>Like the stack of library books that are sitting<br />
by my door, this is long overdue. Now<br />
I'm paying my fines.</p>
<p>This issue is a mishmash of toys, audio gear, and computer stuff.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/Cisco_675.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">No More Squawk:<br />
DSL or Bust</font></p>
<p>I have friends tell me they can't get DSL. I tell them<br />
they can't live without it. No more dial up. No more<br />
busy signals. No more squawk.</p>
<p>If you are going to make the jump to DSL, then you<br />
are going to have to make some equipment choices.</p>
<p>Your first choice will be an internal or external router. A<br />
router is your connection to the outside world. It serves<br />
the same basic need a modem My local phone company was<br />
giving away a free internal router with new service,<br />
that is a router that goes inside your computer. You want<br />
this if you are only going to have one computer. I you want<br />
to connect more than one computer in your office or home<br />
then you want an external router.</p>
<p>If you do go with the external router than you need<br />
a few other things. First your computers need to have<br />
network cards in them. Second you will need a hub.<br />
The hub connects all of your devices on your new<br />
network.</p>
<p>Hooking up all of this equipment gets a bit tough. If<br />
you've never hooked up this type of equipment<br />
before you might not want to start now. Then<br />
again everything might go smooth and you<br />
and your girlfriend an your mom can all surf<br />
at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/aibo1.jpg" alt="AIBO" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">How much is that doggy in the window?</font></p>
<p>My gal an I have been talking about getting a dog for<br />
all of our adult lives. It always comes down to<br />
"we're too busy" or "we don't have a yard". But<br />
seeing punk rock kids with their big old mutts or<br />
the yuppies with their pure breeds has driven us<br />
crazy.</p>
<p>Well the looking has stopped. Sony has put out<br />
it's new electric dog named Aibo. Well, we like to<br />
call ours Caz. We opted for the English model<br />
over the woof/dog model. It's so much cooler<br />
to have your dog say "Hi Bill, you are a sexy<br />
guy" as opposed to "woof, woof, woof, drool".</p>
<p>And if your friends want you to partake in<br />
a weekend getaway, hell just shut the little<br />
guy off, he's only a robot for christsake.</p>
<p>Other features: No peeing, no pooping<br />
no vomiting, no noise, no walks, no humping<br />
your leg, no alergies, no hair on the couch,<br />
no food. Damn it's perfect.</p>

<p><font color="#0099ff">Multi-Track at home : The affordable way</font></p>
<p>I was about to drop a lot of money on the new Mark of the Unicorn<br />
2408 Hard Disk recording system. Sure they make great stuff and<br />
it's compatible with tons of other products. But hell I'm not made out<br />
of money.</p>
<p>My friend down at the noisy music store convinced me<br />
to try out Layla by Echo. I had a couple of weeks to decide and<br />
I could always take it back.</p>
<p>Well so far I've had it a month and there is no turning<br />
back. I've got it in a Pentium 266 with 128mb of RAM,<br />
and this baby is smokin. I've not witnessed a moment<br />
where the sound sags behind. Now I'm not running<br />
30 audio tracks and 20 midi tracks but I've had half<br />
that many and it's great.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/vtpedal.gif" alt="Mesa-Boogie" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Guitars without the amplifier.</font></p>
<p>For the longest time I've tried to get a good<br />
guitar sound on my home recordings and I always<br />
ended up hauling the recording gear down to the<br />
practice space.</p>
<p>I picked up a Mesa Boogie Pre-V Twin amp<br />
and I may have found my solution. I'm not crazy about<br />
the distorted channel but the clean side is perfect. And<br />
since I'm usually playing clean it works.</p>

<h2><a title="Issue #5" href="http://geargab.kingwho.com/?p=12" rel="bookmark">Issue #5</a></h2>
<p>Sure I'm a computer geek and a bit gear happy when it<br />
comes to musical instruments, but what I really want<br />
for Christmas is toys and games.</p>
<p>Here is my wish list.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/chew2.gif" alt="Gum" /></p>
<p>Make Your Own Chewing Gum</p>
<p>This amazing and easy-to-follow kit comes with real chicle gum<br />
base harvested in the rain forest. Includes everything you need<br />
to make 50 pieces of gum.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me, knows of my fondness for gum. This sounds<br />
like a great treat to hand out at parties. I think it only costs $9. It's<br />
made by Schylling Toys, and found at most online toy stores.<br />
<img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/volcano.gif" alt="Volcano" /></p>
<p>Home Made Volcano</p>
<p>Brought to you by the same team that brought you the the gum<br />
maker. Now you can recreate your favorite episode of the Brady Bunch!</p>
<p>This same company also has kits to make gummy bears, chocolate and<br />
a fruit clock that uses the juices of fruit as its battery. Boy, I forgot making<br />
things could be so fun!</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/megablitz.jpg" alt="Nerf" /></p>
<p>Nerf Megablitz Pulsator</p>
<p>I went into Target to try out this years release of Nerf guns. What<br />
I found was that like real guns they are locked up in a case. Not<br />
only that but there is a three day waiting period for any minor not<br />
accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p>So I headed over to the NRA storefront, better known as Wal-Mart.<br />
They not only had the guns on the shelf but they encourged you<br />
to try them out.</p>
<p>My top prize goes to the Nerf Megablitz Pulsator. I judged this on<br />
Four things.</p>
<p>1. Rapid Firing<br />
2. Amount of available amo<br />
3. Reload Time<br />
4. Looks.</p>
<p>The Megablitz won 1 through 3 hands down. Not only did I put<br />
to waste those around me, but they ran in terror. I have to give<br />
the award for looks to the Nerf Electric Eel Blaster which makes<br />
screaching sounds, lightning bolt effects and Alien style design.</p>
<p>My only request is that they make a nerf that will hold more than<br />
eight rounds in it.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/sony.gif" alt="Sony Voice Recorder" /></p>
<p>Sony Handheld Digital Recorders</p>
<p>You've got a million things in your head, one idea being<br />
blasted out by the next. You need someplace to put these.<br />
You need to be able to put it on your computer. You need<br />
to be able to find that note quickly. Your hate tape. Your<br />
Day is way too short.</p>
<p>Well the fine folks at Sony have made this all too easy.<br />
Up to 24 minutes of recording. It is downloadable in<br />
*.wav format. You can even scan through these messages<br />
quickly. Hell with all your brilliant ideas this sucker will<br />
pay for itself in an hour.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/toom_III.gif" alt="games" /><br />
Grim Fandango / Tomb Raider III</p>
<p>Well I've only just got these but my initial reactions are<br />
in. Both look to be big favorites throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider is more story oriented than the last couple<br />
of episodes. I've never gotten stuck so fast in a game,<br />
and so far I refuse to go online to find the cheat codes.</p>
<p>Grim Fandango is a hog to load, but the look, sound and<br />
story are really cool. You play Manny, a travel agent<br />
for the land of the dead. It is a mix of Mexican folklore<br />
and film noir. Along the way things start going wrong and<br />
the game gets plain weird. I've never played anything<br />
quite like this. In a way it reminds me of the "Griffin and<br />
Sabine" books.</p>
<p>As I've only just started on both of these, there will definitely<br />
me more reactions to come.</p>

<h2><a title="Issue #3" href="http://geargab.kingwho.com/?p=10" rel="bookmark">Issue #3</a></h2>
<p>This month I'm going to concentrate on all of the computer toys I've<br />
gotten to play with. I will let you know what flew and what flopped.<br />
I'm going to break this into catagories, and next month I will try<br />
to do an all music gear issue.</p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Scanners</font></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">HP 5100cxi</font></p>
<p>I've set up 6 different scanners in the last couple of months and<br />
have really only liked the HP scanners.</p>
<p>There are some simple things to look for in a scanner like those that<br />
use parallel port and those that use scsi. Parallel port is what your<br />
printer uses. It is built in and therefore easy to install. It is also<br />
slow. SCSI comes built in on a Mac but if you own a PC you will have<br />
to install a card.</p>
<p>I'm not a graphics expert but some of the scanners went in like a charm.<br />
The HP and Umax installed without incident. Microtek and Visioneer were<br />
a bit of a headache and I never want to see another Memorex scanner<br />
again.</p>
<p>All of these were flatbed except the Visioneer PaperPort Strobe which you<br />
feed standard sheets of paper through. It is great for any office needing<br />
to scan hundreds of documents.</p>
<p>The color difference was quite varied. It ranged from great on the HP and<br />
Microtek to horrible on the Umax. Speed more or less stayed right along<br />
these same lines.</p>
<p>Prices stayed pretty much on the line of "you get what you pay for".<br />
The HP, which was on the high end, was $300. The Visioneer was the<br />
low end at $150.</p>
<p>Models</p>
<p>HP Scanjet 5100Cse - $300 *****<br />
Microtek ScanMaker X6 $179<br />
Umax Astra 1220S - $229<br />
Umax Astra 1220P - $149<br />
Memorex SCF 6120P - $149<br />
Visioneer PaperPort Strobe - $149</p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Computers</p>
<p>Dell</font></p>
<p>The computer itself is a tricky one. Everyone seems to be lured away<br />
by these too good to be true deals. If it sounds incredible that a<br />
computer costs $800 then it is probably true. But unless you know<br />
how to tear the thing apart every time there is a little glich, stay<br />
clear. My advice, buy a $2000 computer and submit to the fact that<br />
3 months later new systems will come out that are cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>Now, who makes good computers? Actually, not too many companies do.<br />
Personally I think if you stay with 5 companies you are probably<br />
safe. The big 5 are Compaq, Dell, Gateway, HP, and IBM. My personal<br />
favorite is Dell. But it seems to change quarterly. They have the<br />
one thing that everyone should take advantage of, Technical Support.<br />
If you get it free then use it. Dell happens to have friendly people<br />
who seem to be able to talk to you no matter what level of expertice<br />
you have.</p>
<p>One thing to think about is that the computers that they sell as<br />
"home computers" are usually a lesser quality than the one the sell<br />
as a "buisness computer". The term "desktop" usually refers to the<br />
home computer, where the term "workstation" is referring to the<br />
buisness model.</p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Printers</font><br />
<img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/dj1120c.gif" alt="HP Printer" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">HP 1120C</font></p>
<p>Printers are easy for me. I long ago gave up on canon. Ebson has<br />
never excited me. My pal Scott talked me out of even concidering<br />
Lexmark and Minolta. That leaves Hewlett Packard.</p>
<p>You would think I was on the take for all of my rave of old HP.<br />
The truth is that they make computer periferials that run great<br />
and last a long time. That said There are four HP models that<br />
I would like to mention.</p>
<p>The HP1120C is my personal favorite. Sure it costs $500, but it<br />
prints 11"x17", the color looks great and it is fast.</p>
<p>The HP 890Cse is the same engine as the 1120C but it only does<br />
standard size. It sells for $400, looks great and is fast.</p>
<p>The HP 722C is there scaled down model. It runs for $300 and<br />
is perfect for someone who rarely prints graphics. Hell you<br />
can run to kinkos 3 times a year and save yourself a bundle.</p>
<p>On a different note is the HP 4000N LaserJet. This is the only<br />
laser printer on my list mainly because I haven't worked with<br />
any other models that were outstanding and affordable. This<br />
printer is extremely fast and starts at about $1150.</p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">3COM<br />
PalmPilot Professional and PalmPilot III</font></p>
<p>I know, I know, eveybody wants a Palm Pilot. Well I've played with<br />
one for about 3 months now and my verdict is : Wait. Sure they make<br />
a great date book and you look cool. But how cool are you going to<br />
look next year when real e-mail, web browsers, pagers and synch<br />
programs that work will actually be a reality.</p>
<p>So listen up cyber-dork, let your cell phone answer your e-mails for<br />
another year and get yourself a black book for those really hot dates<br />
because really useful PIF's will be along in about a year or so.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/stealth.jpg" alt="Stealth G460" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Diamond Multimedia Systems<br />
Stealth II G460 Graphics Board</font></p>
<p>This one is on my wish list. I've been reading one great review after<br />
another. This video card comes with 8Mb Ram and the new monster<br />
processor from Intel. All this for only $130. The prices have hit<br />
rock bottom for anothe piece of hardware. I'm installing one on<br />
a friends computer next week and will let you know asap.</p>

<h2><a title="Issue #B" href="http://geargab.kingwho.com/?p=9" rel="bookmark">Issue #B</a></h2>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/pf_SP-202.gif" alt="Dr. Sampler" /></p>
<p>Boss SP-202 Dr. Sample</p>
<p>So now there are a million samplers. But finally we have one<br />
that doesn't require you sit for hours, editing loops and tweaking<br />
it to death. Designed with the live dj in mind this box has it all.<br />
Not only does it have your basics but they've thrown in filters,<br />
delays, ring mods, and the grand daddy of them all, pitch changers.</p>
<p>The pitch changer allows you to change the pitch without<br />
slowing or speeding up the sample. The filter sweeps give the<br />
coolest in analog feel and the ring modulator will fuck the finest<br />
of sounds.</p>
<p>As an extra bonus you can use this as an effect, running live signal<br />
through and processing. At under $400 this is the box of the year.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/philips.jpg" alt="CDr Burner" /></p>
<p>Philips OMNIwriter</p>
<p>Want to burn CDs of your own music, steal software, or just make a<br />
backup of everything you own. Well with the price of a CD burner<br />
now at around $400 dollars what are you waiting for.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/webramp.gif" alt="WebRamp" /></p>
<p>Ramp Networks "WebRamp"</p>
<p>This box is for the small office that wants multiple easy to use<br />
internet connections or the home user that wants more bandwidth<br />
without the hassle of ISDN. It combines an 8 port hub with 3<br />
outputs for standard modems. With one person connected you can<br />
dial out on all 3 modems for triple the bandwidth. For multible<br />
users you can set it up so the bandwidth is devided among those<br />
connected.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/rb15.jpg" alt="Rebirth" /></p>
<p>ReBirth RB-388 v1.5<br />
Techno Micro Composer</p>
<p>The folks at Propeller Software have come up with probably the most<br />
ingenius toy in the computer age. All you need to run this is a good<br />
soundcard and some free time. Containing 2 synths and a drum machine<br />
you can compose until your brain hurts. Who needs techno records after<br />
getting this.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/dm5_product.jpg" alt="Drum Module" /></p>
<p>Alesis DM5 Drum Module</p>
<p>First of all don't call this a drum machine because you need another<br />
device to trigger it. But it contains so many great sounds that it<br />
makes every drummer I've worked with cringe. Using a Roland Octopad<br />
and a standard footswitch you can blow the room apart. I have<br />
particular fondness for the "Sonar" kick drum. and the "Flange"<br />
cymbols.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/clikdisk.gif" alt="CLIK! disk" /></p>
<p>Iomega CLIK!</p>
<p>This is not out yet, but it will revolutionize every small piece of<br />
gear you'll ever own. Samplers, digital cameras and PDAs currently<br />
have up to 4Mb of disk space. This little box will give them 40Mb in<br />
the space of a postage stamp. If you've ever hesitated about buying<br />
possibly obsolete gear this is a good reason to wait until next year.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/the_gang.jpg" alt="The Gang of 5" /></p>
<p>The Gang Of Five</p>
<p>The Gang of Five were first produced in the mid 1950's to the early<br />
1960's by the Masudaya Corporation of Japan. Now Rocket USA is<br />
recreating these classic tin robots although in miniture size. They<br />
run at about $20 each. Rocket USA has other cool tin toy reproductions,<br />
so check them out at www.rocketusa.com</p>

<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/vc3.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Joe Meek ProChannel VC3</font></p>
<p>The ProChannel VC3 is a mic pre-amp/compressor/enchancer all rolled<br />
into a half rack sized box. To me it is the perfect addition to my<br />
home studio. It not only gives me great sound for instruments I<br />
want to plug right into my computer, but it improves my input sounds<br />
on my 4-track as well.</p>
<p>Joe Meek is a California company whose full line of compressors<br />
and mic pre-amps are based on designs originally used by Joe<br />
Meek. He was a British producer/engineer who built all of his<br />
own studio electronics. Joe died in the late 60's and his designs<br />
were preserved by his friend Ted Fletcher</p>
<p>Although some of Joe Meek's devices can get quite spendy, the VC3<br />
is relatively inexpensive. If possible, look for the VC2, which is out<br />
of production but offers some nice input meters not available on<br />
the VC3</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/cavetroopers.jpg" alt="Jedi Knight" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Lucas Arts - Jedi Knight : Dark Forces 2</font></p>
<p>I'm sure most of you are familiar with this already, but I'm having<br />
a blast playing with it. Once I got the light saber I was hooked.<br />
The design is similar to Quake/Doom, but there are many new ideas<br />
used here such as underwater scenes that make your stomach turn.<br />
The other night I started playing around 9pm and it was 5am before<br />
I broke out of my game haze. I'm not even much of a game player but<br />
I'm addicted.</p>
<p>My Mac friends are pissed as usual about having to wait for its<br />
release.</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/pinnicle.gif" alt="Turtle Beach" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Turtle Beach<br />
Pinnicle/Project Studio Sound Card</font></p>
<p>I've had this soundcard for about 5 months and it has been great.<br />
Now I just got an upgrade which added a separate digital I/O card<br />
and a second Kurzweil synth card for a total of 64 killer voices.<br />
I have had some technical problems and their customer support sucks,<br />
but the sound is so good it makes up for it.</p>
<p>The sequencer upgrade that came with it is also excellent. It is<br />
the Voyetra Digital Orchestrator Pro. This easy to use program<br />
allows you to easily control your midi and digital seamlessly from<br />
one interface. I hate to read manuals and this program allowed<br />
me to get to work without opening a book. How's that for laziness?</p>
<p><img src="http://kingwho.com/geargab/gifs/pickle_jar.gif" alt="Pickle Jar" /></p>
<p><font color="#0099ff">Pickle Jar<br />
Voice Processor</font></p>
<p>Friends of mine have known about my infatuation with this device<br />
for over 10 years. The first time I was caught using one I was<br />
the object of jokes for weeks. To me this is what makes the<br />
Mountain Singer sound. I just put a Shure SM-58 into an empty<br />
pickle jar and turn up a little midrange eq to emphasize the<br />
sound. Unfortunately you can't use this on stage. The feed back<br />
would be painful.</p>
