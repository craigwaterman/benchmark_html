				<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, I checked out a few nutrition books from my local library and I just wanted to share some thoughts from my favorite of the books. <u>Food Rules</u>, written by Michael Pollan, is a list of simple “rules” on how to change from the Western diet (think unhealthy, American habits) to a healthier eating style. I love this book so much because you can use it to start making a gradual change towards a healthy diet instead of trying to “quit cold-turkey” from a not-so-healthy diet. For anyone who’s thinking about eating healthier, this book is a must read.</p>
<p>Pollan tackles three big questions: What Should I Eat, What Kind of Food Should I Eat, and How Should I Eat? His basic answer to these questions is “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants”. He then lists about 20 rules per question with a quick explanation that are guidelines to help you eat healthier. Some of his rules I had heard of before reading the book, but some I had never heard before and fell in love with them.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite rules from the book:<br />
2) “Don’t eat anything your great grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food” Imagine how oddly packaged some of our foods are these days. If the packaging alone would confuse her, leave it in the store.<br />
7) “Avoid food products containing ingredients a third-grader cannot pronounce” If the ingredients list looks more like a chemistry class, it’s probably not something you want in your body.<br />
11) “Avoid foods you see advertised on television” Think about it. Have you ever seen an eggplant advertised? No. Because there’s not some big company that’s trying to trick you into buying the eggplant. It’s just a good ol’ healthy eggplant that’s sitting in the store waiting for you to realize it’s potential.<br />
12) “Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle” I’ve heard this rule before and I’ve shared it dozens of times to people who want to eat healthier. The only things I buy in the middle of the store and rice, bread, and the occasional canned good. The rest of the middle is processed junk.<br />
18) “Don’t ingest foods made in places where everyone is required to wear a surgical cap” I had never heard this before, but it makes such a good point. If the people making the food have to protect themselves from it, why should you be eating it? And along the same lines of this…<br />
19) “If it came from a plant, eat it. If it was made in a plant, don’t”</p>
<p>25) “Eat your colors” Having a colorful plate (and no, I don’t mean add food dye to everything) means that you’re getting a bunch of nutrients from different vegetables and fruits.<br />
29) “Eat like an omnivore” This one means to eat a big variety. You shouldn’t only be eating vegetables “because they’re healthy” or only eating meat “because you need more protein”. Keep your plate full of different types of food.<br />
34) “Sweeten and salt your food yourself” You’ll quickly learn that food needs a lot less add ons when you’re doing this.<br />
36) “Don’t eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk” I was never a big fan of cereal in the first place, but if it’s changing the color of the milk, that means it’s full of dyes and chemicals to make it look edible.<br />
37) “The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead” Remember to be eating your whole grains <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span><br />
40) “Be the kind of person who takes supplements-then skip the supplements” This one took me forever to understand. Basically, it’s saying that you should strive to be the kind of person who cares about their health enough to take supplements, but then instead of taking the supplements, eat a diet that’s well balanced and already has the vitamins and minerals you need.</p>
<p>47) “Eat when you are hungry, not when you are bored” I used to be such a snacker when I watched TV shows, not because I was hungry, but because during commercial breaks, I would get up and check out the fridge and cupboards to keep myself busy. So happy I’ve broken this habit!<br />
52) “Buy smaller plates and glasses” This is a big one for portion control. You’re much more likely to overeat if you fill up your entire plate. Instead, eat from a smaller plate and get seconds only if you’re still hungry.<br />
55) “Eat meals” Instead of snacking all day, plan some good quality meals and then if you need a snack in between, make sure it’s healthy.<br />
57) “Don’t get your fuel from the same place your car does” Love this! Gas is made from corn and if your food is full of high-fructose corn syrup, you should probably be rethinking about what you’re eating.<br />
62) “Plant a vegetable garden if you have space, a window box if you don’t” There’s something so special about eating food that you grew yourself and knowing exactly where it came from.<br />
63) “Cook” The most basic rule there is. If you’re cooking your meals instead of letting companies do it for you, you’ll realize what’s actually going into your food and naturally, you’ll start eating healthier. And lastly, but certainly not least…<br />
64) “Break the rules once in a while” What’s the point in eating healthy 24/7 if you can’t take a break and enjoy a cheat meal or a cheat dessert once in a while?</p>
<p>Those were my favorites from the book, but if you want to hear more of his rules, check the book out from the library, buy it on Amazon for $0.01 or if you’re tech savy, click <a href="http://www.healthmantra.com/food_guide.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> for a link to a PDF version of the book. Happy reading and I hope you like his &#8220;rules&#8221; as much as I do!</p>

		<p>Some people hate them, others love them, but most people have a love/hate relationship with them. Personally, I&#8217;m in the love/hate boat with rest days. As someone who loves working out, not working out once or twice a week drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I could be making more progress without them. The whole day, I feel like I&#8217;m missing a part of my day and that I need to lace up and hit the streets or spend just ten minutes sneaking in a few body weight exercises in my room. With that being said, I do love and look forward to rest days &#8211; the feeling of having an extra hour in my day to do whatever I want is something I crave every week. Despite my love/hate relationship with rest days, the proven benefits of keeping them in my weekly routine outweigh however I feel about them.</p>
<p>One of the most important reasons why rest days need to be a regular part of any workout routine is that they give your body a chance to recover. No matter what type of exercise you do, your body will eventually need to recover from how hard you&#8217;ve been pushing it. Rest days allow your body to repair your muscles, tendons, and ligaments, which don&#8217;t heal as well if they&#8217;re being worked daily.  Along the same lines of allowing your body to recover, rest days also prevent injuries. Injuries most often occur because your body isn&#8217;t recovering enough between workouts and it can&#8217;t keep up with how hard you&#8217;re pushing it. As a runner, my best runs tend to be the day after rest day because I&#8217;m not sore and I can push myself knowing I gave my body time to heal from the previous week and not have to worry as much about getting injured.</p>
<p>Another reason why rest days are crucial in any workout plan is because over-training will cause you to plateau. I&#8217;ve seen this happen to almost everyone, including myself. You&#8217;re making great progress toward your goals, so you forgo a rest day to push yourself more, but eventually, you hit a wall that you can&#8217;t pass no matter how much training you put in. This is known as over-training and it&#8217;s often hard to tell if you&#8217;re doing it because working out as much as you can feels great! If you&#8217;re stuck on your workout plan, consider adding an extra rest day to give your body more time to recover and eventually get stronger and faster.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of my favorite reasons to keep a rest day or two in a workout plan is they keep me motivated to keep pushing for my goals. If you&#8217;re pushing yourself day in and day out, it&#8217;s really nice to be able to take a day off from exercising and remember why you&#8217;re doing this. Rest days shouldn&#8217;t be about sitting on the couch doing nothing and eating junk all day, but rather using the time off to your advantage. I like to use my rest days to relax with family and friends or even just take some time for myself. Once in a while, I&#8217;ll even use my rest days to plan my meals for the week or look up new healthy recipes, but you can do whatever you want with your rest days.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve hopefully convinced you to add rest days into your workout plan, how often you do them is up to you. Most people like to do anywhere from one to three a week, but it depends on what kind of plan you&#8217;re following. If you&#8217;re working different muscles groups each day, you could probably do just one a week. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re running 5 miles a day, every day of the week, I&#8217;d say cut back to four or five days of running, adding in some time to recover. Personally, I like to have one full rest day a week and then one day a week where I do yoga and other stretching to help my muscles and joints recover from long runs. My workout plans are normally about two months long, so at the end of a plan before I start a new one, I like to take three days to a full week off to give my body much needed rest.</p>
<p>Lesson is: whatever you&#8217;re doing for exercise, remember that rest days will help you in the long run, so even if you hate them, add them in and eventually, you&#8217;ll learn to love them.</p>

		<p>For those of you who are just getting to know me, or those that have known me for years, I made this blog for a few reasons, one being that I wanted to share a piece of my life with anyone who was interested in hearing about it. Being active has always been important to me and in the past few years, I&#8217;ve shifted my thinking from just being active to making healthy choices and staying fit.</p>
<p>Around March of my senior year, I signed up for my first race: the Mom&#8217;s on the Run 5k in my hometown. I had liked running before this &#8211; I even joined the middle school track team in 8th grade &#8211; but I had never done more than one and a half miles at a time. So, March 17th, 2013, I started training. I followed the Couch to 5k program, as many beginning runners do, and I LOVED IT! I started realizing how much I loved to just get out there, clear my thoughts, and run. That summer, I kept running a few times a week, but with no goal in sight, I didn&#8217;t stay very motivated.</p>
<p>In the fall, I started my first year at Boston University. With the craziness of freshman year (including the stress of choosing to change my major to Health Science in the first two months), I didn&#8217;t realize I hadn&#8217;t gone on a run or worked out until about Thanksgiving and by that time, I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to just get up and run a 5k any time I felt like it. I made it my New Years Resolution in 2014 to get back to being active, so starting in January, I kept a log of everything I was doing exercise-wise. I started working out a the gym &#8211; the elliptical being my new best friend, as well as those ten minute ab or yoga videos you can find on YouTube. During spring break, I decided to do the Mother&#8217;s Day 5k again, so I re-did the Couch to 5k program and after the race in May, I got an app to keep track of my running, knowing that seeing it everyday would help to keep me motivated.</p>
<p>Since last May, I&#8217;ve kept active with going to the gym regularly and running (preferable outside, but I will step on the dreaded treadmill if need be). During my sophomore year at school, I focused on not only working out, but also eating right, doing research along the way to see how I could best fit healthy eating into my lifestyle. I now make my own workout and running plans for 8+ week stretches at a time (shout-out to Hal Higdon for help on designing the longer running plans). I do my best to eat healthy and this spring, I&#8217;ve run two 5ks, one of which I placed #1 in my age group, I completed my first Tough Mudder and I ran my first half marathon.</p>
<p>So now that you know my background, what does this blog &#8220;Happy Means Healthy&#8221; really mean? Well, first off, I know for everyone that being happy doesn&#8217;t always mean being healthy, but for me, I&#8217;m at my happiest when I&#8217;m healthiest. I in no way claim to be an expert on health and fitness, but I&#8217;ve learned a few tips and tricks along my journey and I want to share them with anyone who is looking for advice or just for something entertaining to read. My goal is to try to post weekly updates or ramblings on something health and fitness related, so if you ever have a topic you&#8217;d like to see more about, feel free to contact me!</p>
