			<p>The saying &#8220;fake it till you make it&#8221; is a pretty poplar saying in today&#8217;s society and it&#8217;s being so overused that it&#8217;s meaning has got lost in the mix.</p>
<p>First and foremost &#8212; you will NEVER be someone you are not. All your quirks, your traits and personality will always remain with you no matter how deep you bury them. You are who you are. The most admired and successful human beings are the ones that become fully in-touch with themselves. They learn everything there is to know about themselves and they&#8217;re content with it. Those are the ones that are truly at peace.</p>
<p>So, why is it so important to &#8220;fake it til you make it&#8221;, when happiness only comes from acting yourself? Well this is where the misconception lies. &#8220;Fake it til you make it&#8221; does not mean change personality and pretend to be someone your not. What is means is that you need to &#8220;fake&#8221; confidence and tell yourself that you can accomplish anything regardless of your competence. In this aspect, faking it is healthy!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>A brief story on how I took this saying the wrong way:</p>
<p>There was this girl I had became quite attracted to after hanging out with a few times. I got that same puppy dog love that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. Just thinking about her put me in a good mood. I kept tell myself that I can&#8217;t screw this up. Everything I say to her via text and in person needs to be smooth as hell and perfect. So I started reading about relationships and the mind of a female. This saying, &#8220;fake it til you make it&#8221; kept popping up. It didn&#8217;t seem sincere to me, but it made sense. You have to reel the fish in before you can take it home, right? I&#8217;m not some suave women slayer what-so-over. In fact, I&#8217;m much more reserved and soft-spoken. However, women want alpha, headstrong men that know where they&#8217;re going in life. That must mean I need to fake that til I make it.</p>
<p>This is where I noticed she started losing interest. I couldn&#8217;t understand why. Her friends told me she was interested and we&#8217;ve hung out before, so what&#8217;s the problem now? After I stopped talking to her after a few weeks I decided to read through some of our old texts. I knew instantly what it was. All those texts weren&#8217;t me. It was someone I was pretending to be and it was all just so unnatural. I got so caught up in pretending to be someone that I couldn&#8217;t be and that&#8217;s what made me lose the girl.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>You are the BEST at being YOU! You will fail over and over again trying to acquire traits that you don&#8217;t already have because you can&#8217;t have them. You may be thinking, damn I wish I was more outgoing and outspoken. Well, learn to cater your own personality traits in a more outgoing/outspoken manner. A quiet person can be outgoing in many ways. Putting a big smile on your face is outgoing. Waving to people on the street is outgoing. Your personality traits are so versatile that it&#8217;s actually quite amazing.</p>
<p>Acting someone your not is torture. People will see through fake personalities and it&#8217;s unattractive. However, learning to be yourself will make you feel comfortable and that comfortability will draw people to you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fake it til you make it&#8221; means to tell yourself that you can do it even thought you might not know how to. It means to say YES to every opportunity regardless of the circumstances. It means that you need to trick yourself into believing that you are capable. Don&#8217;t be fooled like I was.</p>

			<p>The grey area between introverts and extroverts is <strong>massive </strong>and people are too quick to label themselves.</p>
<p>Just because the idea of partying on the weekend gets you excited does not make you an extrovert and just because you enjoy a cup of coffee while reading a book does not make you an introvert. It just makes you someone who enjoys partying and coffee.</p>
<p>Putting yourself under a certain category can minimize your potential growth as a human being. People do not realize how detrimental this can be and since introversion and extroversion are such well known and encompassing character traits, it can really put a damper on your true self &#8212; who you really are.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s my brief story</em> &#8212; My whole life I believed I was an introvert. Everything I read on the Internet, all the introvert/extrovert tests I took, and all the research I did made me realize that I was something they call introverted. This was such a relieving discovery. It explained why I&#8217;d rather have dinner alone than with friends, why the idea of staying in during the weekends seemed appealing, why I&#8217;d rather sit and listen rather than stand and be outspoken, and it described all the little quirks in my personality. It was reassuring knowing that I wasn&#8217;t some social outcast who was fated to a life of loneliness. I found comfort in the fact that I was an introvert.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d read more and more about introversion each week. It says that introverts don&#8217;t like crowded social settings, so that means I must not like crowded social settings. It says introverts aren&#8217;t leader-types, so I must be a follower. I&#8217;d feed my brain all this information and slowly but surely I became someone I never was. I started to sink into depression from the social isolation put myself through. I started to become anxious around other people; even my close friends that I used to have solid relationships with. I longed for a female counterpart, but I deprived myself of that due to my self induced timidity. I&#8217;d become all these things because I labelled myself as an introvert and made myself believe that I was someone I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I caught myself in the act. I reevaluated my life and decided I wanted change. I went out more, said YES to all social gatherings, answered the phone every time friends called, and the more I said YES, then the more my brain blocked out all the depression and anxieties caused from this false label. I started to realize I wasn&#8217;t so much of an introvert, but instead just used it as an excuse for my lack of social skills and addiction to isolation.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Yes, people do have introverted and extroverted qualities, but I firmly believe that one cannot solely be either. A person will possess qualities from both ends of the spectrum and this is healthy. Personally, I&#8217;ve found that putting myself out there and being social is great for my mental health, but at the same time I&#8217;m fully capable of enjoying my own company. They say an introvert replenishes their energy in their lonesome, while an extrovert replenishes theirs being around others, but at least for me it&#8217;s very situational. Being alone can put me in a great mood, but sometimes it&#8217;ll kick in the loneliness. You&#8217;ve got to assess yourself and understand what your life needs. No one knows you better than yourself.</p>
<p>In a perfect world people would define themselves based on their life experiences. I really discourage people from self-diagnosing themselves via Internet. Research is good, but naturally we start to convince ourselves we&#8217;re something we&#8217;re not and that&#8217;s where the harm comes into play. Each person is unique in there own way and there is not one label that can define you. Don&#8217;t tie yourself down and let yourself grow through experiences.</p>

			<p>There is no such thing as the past or the future. They do not exist, there is only now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy concept to grasp, but we tend to caught up in what has been and what might be that we tend to forget. The past is what the now was. The future is what our now foreshadows &#8212; if that makes sense.</p>
<p>The future is all imaginary. It&#8217;s all what we fear or hope the &#8220;now&#8221; might create. It&#8217;s simply a day dream. We can never live in the future because the future is always one step ahead. Therefore, the future can never exist. Our ideal future will never become reality without the present. However, you can never know what lies in your future because you&#8217;ve only got as far as now.</p>
<p>The past is just a fleeting memory. They&#8217;re memories that you may share with others, but mostly yourself. Everyone else is too caught up in their own past that yours is typically irrelevant to them. Unlike the future, the past did once exist, but no longer does. Laid to rest and never to return. The past cannot effect your present unless your mind and thoughts let it to.</p>
<p>The irony of it all is that we let our mind &#8220;exist&#8221; in the past or the future for most of our lives. Worrying about what might come or what has came. Hoping for something to come along and exist in our present or wishing that something never once did exist. The only reality we have is the present. This is the only thing that can possibly exist. It is impossible for us to physically live in the past or future, but our minds start to wander and our present soon becomes our past. Training your brain to live isn&#8217;t easy. Recognize each time your mind starts to wander from the now. Grasp your hopes and dreams and realize that they&#8217;ll never become unless you let your present self allow them to. Let go of your past and let them remain memories. Reminisce on occasion, but understand that they&#8217;re no long gone.</p>
<p>The present is the only this that can possibly be real.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m beginning to feel like a diehard feminist. The subtle angst towards something which seems so minor is getting the best of me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s with this generation of women and their fixation on bearded men?</p>
<p>The worst part is that I can&#8217;t bring this up in conversation because personally, I can&#8217;t grow a well kept beard. It&#8217;ll backfire and people will just tell me I&#8217;m jealous because I can&#8217;t grow one. No, even if I could grow a Jeff Bridges worthy beard I&#8217;d pass. The griminess and inconvenience doesn&#8217;t appeal to me.</p>
<p>This beard endearment never even occurred to me until I saw a photo someone posted on Instagram captioned &#8220;If you don&#8217;t workout and can&#8217;t grow a beard you&#8217;re a girl.&#8221; Now that&#8217;s really fucked and as ignorant as that picture may sound I believe it&#8217;s definitely the mindset most women have. If I said that women who have cup-sizes smaller than C&#8217;s are boys, then I wouldn&#8217;t hear the end of it. I&#8217;d get called sexist. However, it&#8217;s virtually the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There are two conclusions I&#8217;ve drawn from this beard lusting generation of ladies.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. It&#8217;s just a fashion trend. </strong></em></p>
<p>Trends, hairstyles, and fashion come and go with the decades. It could be just that and pretty soon these men will have to bust out the loppers. It seemed like a gradual change. It started off with the clean cut, smooth as a babies butt, then onto the stubbled 5 o&#8217;clock shadow, and evolving into these god awful dust catchers. The worst is when men fall into this trap and attempt to grow something worthy, but end up looking like cookie duster&#8217;s with a face.</p>
<p>It will pass. Let&#8217;s just hope beard trends go in full circle instead of the next fashion being gangly beards down to your chest.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. </strong><strong>Most women feel more &#8220;secure&#8221; around men with father-like features.</strong></em></p>
<p>In an age where it&#8217;s an essential for ladies to carry pepper spray around in their purses, maybe beards are just a reminder of safety to them. Everyone&#8217;s father had a beard and when you were a child you could never feel any more safe with your dad by your side.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to stereotype, but I&#8217;ve found that women dating clean-cut dudes seems to be more reserved, while women dating scruffy men tend to be more outgoing. I&#8217;ll make the assumption that these ladies are more outgoing because they have that safety net of a beard protecting them and letting them do as they please.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Beardless men, revel in your patchy glory! When beards get banished to trendy purgatory that&#8217;ll be the day. When women tell their boyfriends it&#8217;s time to pull the plug and shave that monstrous thing only to reveal that they&#8217;ve been packing a double chin and an undefined jawline, then we&#8217;ll have our laugh.</p>
<p>For now, we&#8217;ll let your lady run her hands through the hair on your head &#8212; how it should be!</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s a struggle for everyone; some more some less. Even a self proclaimed &#8221;morning person&#8221; has trouble getting themselves up. One can enjoy the morning, but the physical act of pulling yourself out of that warm comfort zone is a strife we must all face.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be so bad. They say after 5 seconds you&#8217;re out of bed the bad morning feeling will fully go away. On top of all these other tips remind yourself each morning that you only have to endure 5 seconds. Each second longer that you wait is more torture that you&#8217;re putting yourself through. Here are some tips that helped me change from someone who hated that first light to someone that absolutely loves the smell of fresh morning air.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Give yourself something to look forward to. </strong></span></p>
<p>This can be anything, but I prefer food or drink choices. I own a Keurig machine that makes brewing coffee, tea and hot chocolate really easy. When I wake up the first this I do is run to that machine and let it warm up. Coffee or any hot beverage is best when you&#8217;re still half awake and feeling groggy. It tastes great plus it&#8217;ll help you wake up!</p>
<p>Food is great too. I know this is probably extremely unhealthy, but I was at a really low point in my sleeping habits and what really changed that around was ice cream. Who doesn&#8217;t love ice cream and who says we can&#8217;t eat it in the morning? I&#8217;d have my favorite Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s flavor waiting for me in the fridge and all I had to do was get up; that was the only thing separating me from my ice cream. It put me in a good mood, but I&#8217;d make sure I washed it down with lots of water.</p>
<p>Bacon, eggs, cereal, you name it. Find something quick and easy to make and have it ready the night before.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Have everything prepared the night before.</strong></span></p>
<p>Waking up to chores and tasks will just make waking up even more of a challenge. So have &#8220;night time you&#8221; take care of &#8220;morning you&#8221; by doing all their chores for them. Here are some things you can do the night before to make mornings chore free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hang all of your clothes over your shower curtain so it&#8217;s easily accessible after you hop out of the shower.</li>
<li>Put your tooth brush and paste in the shower. Two birds with one stone. I know this sounds silly, but it&#8217;s actually really efficient and makes the mundane task of scrubbing your teeth not so mundane. (Be wary of bacteria forming in damp places!)</li>
<li>Have all your food (if refrigeration not needed), cooking utensils, and drinks out and ready to go.</li>
<li>Clean your house. Seeing clutter in the morning won&#8217;t put you in a good mood!</li>
<li>Have your favorite tunes queued up and ready to play.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Put your alarm out of reach.</strong></span></p>
<p>My brain is programmed to repeatedly hit the snooze button. I swear I&#8217;m not even awake, but subconsciously my arm reaches over and hits snooze when I hear the alarm go off. I&#8217;ll keep hitting that button over and over again and the repercussions of sleeping in won&#8217;t even matter.</p>
<p>The solution is easy. Put your alarm out of reach. You won&#8217;t be able to fall back to sleep with that annoying sound going off. Theoretically, it&#8217;ll take you at least 5 seconds to get up and turn off your alarm, so by that time the lousiness of getting up will subside. This trick is one of my favorites because there is no way out. You have to get up no matter what.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Make your alarm tone pretty &#8212; Switch it up.</strong></span></p>
<p>Most people overlook this one. Why does an alarm sounds have to be so damn ugly? It doesn&#8217;t! My alarm is currently set to crashing ocean waves and I&#8217;ll change it to something different every week. If you keep the same alarm tone then your brain will start negatively associating that sound. If you keep the tones fresh and lovely then your brain won&#8217;t have enough time to do that. Waking up to the sounds of rain or birds chirping is actually quite a poetic feeling. I&#8217;ve already associated sounds like these with positive things, so hearing them in the morning will make me feel no different.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Try a different form of an &#8220;alarm&#8221;.</strong></span></p>
<p>For a few months the sound on my phone was broken, so the only way I was able to wake myself up was by putting my phone on vibrate and laying it under my pillow while I sleep. It worked quite well actually. The pillow cushioned the vibration so it wasn&#8217;t startling and if you enjoy absolute silence in the morning it&#8217;s what you get. Try this.</p>
<p>You can also get creative. Be like this guy &#8212;&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ-l5PlDa-k" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ-l5PlDa-k</a></p>
<p>Have a roommate calmly wake you up or if you&#8217;re a dog expert see if you can train your dog to double as an alarm clock. The possibilities are endless and it could be fun trying new techniques!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>The morning is absolutely lovely. The calmness when you look out the window is so serene and the way everything moves at a different pace is quite interesting. It&#8217;s really the only time of the day that is yours, so own it and don&#8217;t let sleep steal it from you.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get up early mornings then you&#8217;re really missing out!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Depression and anxiety does not doom you to failure. The enormity of this misconception is unbearable. People throw in the towel once they realize that their problems never truly vanish. I did for a long time. As a living human being you&#8217;re capable of driving your life in whichever direction you wish.</p>
<p>I would always ask myself, <strong>&#8220;Will I ever be able to live a normal and fulfilling life?&#8221;</strong> &#8212; Eventually I realized how absurd of a question that was. Instead of going on about how to steer your life in a positive direction, I&#8217;ll take a different approach and tell you how your problems can be turned into something beneficial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">You&#8217;re far more empathetic than most and you can truly understand emotion.<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been in-touch with such overwhelming emotions your whole life. You know them front to back. You know what causes them, how they&#8217;ll make you react, and some of you have even learned how to cope. What you&#8217;re feeling is so prominent that you can almost feel them coming before they even happen. All your emotions, good and bad, are so much more &#8220;real&#8221; and receptive. There are plenty of people in this world that feel emotionless and you&#8217;re definitely not one of them.</p>
<p>You now possess a very important ability that you might not even know you had. You&#8217;re truly able to understand how someone feels and what&#8217;s their state of mind. I bet you could tell if a person you&#8217;ve just met is either facing depression or anxiety in their life just from talking to them for a few minutes. You know how emotions are supposed to feel almost <em>too </em>well and that is a good thing. It gives you an advantage when trying to relate to people and will generally make you come off as more likeable. If people generally come to you when they have problems, then you now know why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>You&#8217;re a critical thinker.</strong></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what exactly drives my deep and over analytical thought process, but I do know it stems from the depression and anxieties I face. I do believe most of you are no different. You don&#8217;t take anything for face value and you have a knack for over thinking things. Instead of just accepting things for what they are you&#8217;ll question and question until you find an answer&#8230; most of the time you&#8217;ll confuse yourself even more, but at least you&#8217;re asking question. People should question everything.</p>
<p>Questioning things is what separates the critical thinkers from the simple minded (and I don&#8217;t mean that in a derogatory term). Without critical thinkers life would be dull. Without critical thinkers no one would ask the real questions. Without critical thinkers our society wouldn&#8217;t progress. The world absolutely needs critical thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>You&#8217;re good at hiding emotions.</strong></span></p>
<p>This is definitely a good thing. All of those fake smiles and phony laughter has amounted to something. All those days you woke up feeling like your soul sunk to the darkest depths of the ocean, yet you still managed to get out of bed and pretend to act excited and giddy around your classmates/co-worker, it all amounted to something. You&#8217;re a master at hiding how you feel.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t permanently conceal your feelings. To live a healthy life it&#8217;s imperative to open up to those you trust, but when people wear their heart on their sleeves they become vulnerable. In fact, they are the most vulnerable types of people. There are malicious people that will take advantage of those who put their emotions on display because they are so easy to manipulate, but not you. You put on a great disguise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>You excel in the arts.</strong></span></p>
<p>Most of us find it hard to express ourselves through spoken word, so it&#8217;s typically substituted with a form of art . Most of the greatest writers, poets, musicians, and artists in the world face some form of depression and anxiety and it&#8217;s no coincidence. Our strong connection we have with our emotions enhances our creativity and that creativity stems into our expressionism.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t found a type of art you enjoy, then keep looking. It&#8217;s feels great to sit down spill your heart out on to a piece of paper or transcribe your feelings into song lyrics.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take these four benefits and practice them. You may not be the most critical of thinkers or maybe you do wear your heart on your sleeve, but you have the ability to change that and be great at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Fourth year student and transferring next semester to finish up my degree. I&#8217;ve done it all. I&#8217;ve failed classes, I&#8217;ve been the top student in my class, I&#8217;ve taken classes from sociology to film, I&#8217;ve taken a year off to work full time, I&#8217;ve partied hard and partied none. Literally all across the board. I didn&#8217;t know what college was about when I first started back in 2011. My high school teachers and counselors never warned me. Their advice they gave me was so dated that it didn&#8217;t even apply to the new scheme of college life. Here&#8217;s are some tips from my rollercoaster of an experience.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>1. Major in something viable and minor in something you enjoy.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the safest bet and you can&#8217;t regret you&#8217;re decisions if you have both under your belt. I switched between three majors during my four years. I kept second guessing myself. I wanted to write and do film at first, so I took a bunch of film and screenwriting classes. After doing research online and realizing how many film graduates are jobless and how little job opportunities there are in the film industry, it scared me. So I thought I&#8217;ll switch to English. I love writing and it seems broad enough to have plenty of jobs. Well, not really. I didn&#8217;t want to be a teacher or do a job writing what others wanted me to write. So after two years of flip-flopping I&#8217;m now a business major. It feels good knowing that I have something to fall on to, but at the same time I&#8217;m able to write and study film congruently. </p>
<p><strong>2. If you don&#8217;t wish to minor in something, then major in something you love.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re paying for this education, so if classes are a drag then what&#8217;s it worth? It&#8217;s a service you&#8217;re paying for and lately parents and teachers have been pushing students to play it safe and stick with a &#8220;popular&#8221; major. This type of thinking is what is killing college. It&#8217;s no longer about discovering and mastering your passions. It&#8217;s turned into a way of saying, &#8220;Hey, if you stick to this recommended path, then we can almost guarantee you a job in the future!&#8221; This is never what college was intended to be. You&#8217;ll succeed and enjoy your experiencer far greater if you&#8217;re studying a subject you&#8217;re passionate about. After all, most employers only look to see if you have any form of a degree regardless of what the subject matter is. Having any type of degree shows that you&#8217;re capable of hurdling obstacles and have the brain capacity to take in new information.</p>
<p><strong>3. Get a job.</strong></p>
<p>Studies have shown that students that work 15-25 hours a week achieve better grades. I can attest to this. You would think not working at all would grant you more time to fully focus on studies, but it works quite the opposite. &#8220;Idle time is the devil&#8217;s workshop.&#8221; At least personally, not having a job and being a fulltime student made me lazy. I&#8217;d find excuses to watch Netflix before I started my homework. My mind didn&#8217;t feel as sharp as it did when I was working 30 hours. When you have a job and go to school, then it forces you to get your work done. You want that extra time at the end of the day to relax, so you make yourself get all your school work done early. I did FAR better in school while having a job.</p>
<p><strong>4. Have a conversation with someone new.</strong></p>
<p>Do it every day when given the opportunity. College is a huge conglomeration of people from all over the world and different walks of life. Just having a brief conversation will teach you new things and really broaden your perspective. Striking up a conversation will give you the opportunity to make new friends and acquaint yourself with people that you could partner up with post-college. Networking is huge. The first day of class it&#8217;s imperative that you meet the people sitting next to you. You&#8217;ll need to be able to contact them if you need help on an assignment or if you miss class. If you click with the person always exchange numbers. Everyone is looking for new companions, but most people are too shy to start up a chat. They&#8217;ll be ecstatic when you start talking to them.</p>
<p><strong>5. C&#8217;s get degrees, but not a noteworthy GPA.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;s get degrees&#8221; is a lazy person&#8217;s saying. I can&#8217;t recall all the times I&#8217;ve heard it. After hearing it so many times I started to agree with it until I saw my GPA after one semester. I&#8217;m passing all my classes, so why is my GPA so low? Those C&#8217;s definitely take a toll and a GPA separates the ones that skim through college and the ones that really worked their asses off. Employers and other colleges (if you intend on transferring) will definitely look at your GPA.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t stress about a flunked class or low GPA.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the great majority of students have at least flunked one class. It doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the end of the world, it just means you need to retake it. Most colleges even have some programs that will allow you to completely remove these failed grades off your transcript. If you failed it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re dumb, it means you didn&#8217;t give your full effort. If your GPA is low, then focus on getting B&#8217;s and A&#8217;s and within a few semesters your GPA will shoot up in no time.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do not skip classes.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy to skip and there were classes that I can safely say I skipped half of them and I don&#8217;t need to tell you what grades resulted from that. Some people can pull off skipping a bunch of classes, but they&#8217;re just gambling. If they skip all their classes and happen to pass it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re some kid genius, it means they were lucky that their professor happened to be an easy grader. You&#8217;ll tell yourself that today is only a lecture and I have a good grade in the class already, it won&#8217;t hurt to skip today. College works against you and I promise you, that day you think is safe to skip will be the day your teacher gives a pop quiz or assigns a random in-class assignment. It&#8217;s not worth playing hooky. You&#8217;re paying for these classes, so get your money&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p><strong>8. Classes are generally easy.</strong></p>
<p>Some classes I&#8217;ve taken were an absolute joke. I had taken high school classes that were far more challenging. Don&#8217;t sign up for classes with the mindset that it will be extremely difficult. Classes aren&#8217;t designed for failure, they&#8217;re designed to teach you things. It&#8217;s not like high school where they&#8217;re trying to assess your knowledge. Instead they&#8217;re trying to give you knowledge to achieve your ultimate goal of earning a degree. Don&#8217;t let the fear of thinking college is too challenging sway you from choosing tough classes. With the exclusion of genuinely brain-melting classes, they&#8217;re all fairly easy.</p>
<p><strong>9. College is not the way movies portray them.</strong></p>
<p>You aren&#8217;t going to show up to your dorm the first day on campus and people will be partying up and down the halls. You won&#8217;t attend a party to find strip poles, flashing lights, and drugs in giant salad bowls. Beautiful women won&#8217;t be eye-raping you from across the lecture hall. Yes, there are parties. Some of them will be extravagant, but most of them will be no different from high school. Don&#8217;t get discouraged when you learn that the college you&#8217;ve attended isn&#8217;t much of a party school because it&#8217;s the same every where. Your buddy who attended ASU isn&#8217;t raving his face off, he&#8217;s doing the same thing you&#8217;re doing. Focus on studies because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re there for. You&#8217;ll be able to party until you&#8217;re old and can&#8217;t walk anymore. Don&#8217;t stress out about spending a Saturday night alone and doing nothing. It&#8217;s what a lot of people do. In fact cherish those times spent alone.</p>
<p><strong>10. Exercise and volunteer.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let studies take up all your time. You&#8217;re still a person and you need to work on yourself. Exercising at least 3 times a week will not only make you look better, but also feel better. It&#8217;ll release certain chemicals in your brain that&#8217;ll boost your confidence and potentially improve your success in school work. It&#8217;ll help prevent depression and anxiety, which I&#8217;m sure every college student has experienced a form of. Volunteering is also a great way to meet people, learn new things, and ultimately better your social skills. To be honest it&#8217;s probably the best way to practice social skills. I&#8217;ve noticed that I have far less trouble starting a conversation with a random person just from volunteering through various Craiglist ads. It has even helped relieve a lot of the anxiety that follows from talking to a lady you think is attractive.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>All in all, college is about you. Make it about you and do not let other people influence the lifelong desicions you will make. Get good grades, meet people, improve your life, and take in all the new information that is being thrown at you. College does not guarantee you anything, so take what you can get. If you feel like something is wrong or things aren&#8217;t going the way you wish they had, then pinpoint the problem and fix it. Change things up. Start off new.</p>
<p>College isn&#8217;t too scary after all.<br />
