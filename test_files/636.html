			<h2>O-nii-kei Blazes On</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>For the last six months, Japanese male fashion fans have been waiting in great anticipation for the opening of department store <a href="http://www.hankyu-dept.co.jp/" target="_blank">Hankyu</a>&#8216;s new Men&#8217;s building in Osaka — aptly named <a href="http://www.hankyu-dept.co.jp/honten/hankyu-mens/index.html">Hankyu Men&#8217;s</a>. This annex to the main building would bring together the widest selection of top-class and popular fashion brands every assembled under one roof. Designer brands Comme des Garçons, Lanvin, Dior Homme, and Maison Martin Margiela would be available, as well as luxury powerhouses Gucci, Prada, and Salvatore Ferragamo. More traditional-minded working men could browse Paul Stuart, J. Press, Brooks Brothers, and Ralph Lauren Purple Label. Tom Ford would offer his very first retail space in Japan.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Hankyu Men&#8217;s finally opened for business, attracting 180,000 shoppers in three days. According to the <em>Senken Shimbun</em>, Louis Vuitton first-ever men&#8217;s only boutique apparently brought in the highest revenues of any tenant (thus proving that LV is not only for women in Japan).</p>
<p>The number two winner, however, was quite a surprise. With almost all the first-tier brands lined up for direct competition, this was quite possibly a battle for the mind and soul of the Japanese fashion market. Even with so many European luxury houses, designer labels, Ivy League standards, and prestigious licenses offered, the brand earning the second-highest sales ended up being <a href="http://www.buffalo-bobs.com/" target="_blank">Buffalo Bobs </a>— a leader in the relatively new &#8220;O-nii-kei&#8221; fashion subculture. In three days, this up-and-coming &#8220;wild and sexy&#8221; casual brand raked in ¥9.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>O-nii-kei</strong> — meaning &#8220;big brother style&#8221; — has crystallized over the last few years as a more market-friendly, classically-masculine version of the <em>&#8220;gyaru-o&#8221;</em> taste culture. The <em>gyaru-o</em> were the young men who used to hang out with the more extreme &#8220;<em>ganguro</em>&#8221; members of the <a href="http://www.hankyu-dept.co.jp/"><em>gyaru</em></a> subculture in Shibuya. Now these boys have grown up, abandoned the crazy face paint and garish clothing, and outfitted themselves with aviator glasses, fur-trimmed nylon parkas, buccaneer boots, poofy bronzed hair, and as much silver as could be possible worn on the human body. (Think <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/07/great-happiness-spac.html" target="_blank">hosts</a>). The central location for O-nii-kei is Shibuya (more specifically, fifth and sixth floors of Shibuya 109-2), but the look has spread across the archipelago. (For some visual examples of the style, check Patrick Macias&#8217; excellent coverage <a href="http://patrickmacias.blogs.com/er/2007/12/mens-egg---the.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://patrickmacias.blogs.com/er/2008/01/why-dont-we-tal.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://patrickmacias.blogs.com/er/2007/12/merry-christmas.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>With the fashion market slowly crumbling and foreign &#8220;Japan Cool&#8221; hunters looking for the next big thing amongst Japanese youth, you&#8217;d think more observers in the Japanese and international media class would be falling all over O-nii-kei. Here is a self-contained fashion movement that has created a real economic market, despite little attention from the apparel manufacturing giants and media support dependent upon independent fashion titles <em>Men&#8217;s Egg</em> and <em>Men&#8217;s Knuckle</em>.</p>
<p>The darkly-tanned boys of O-nii-kei, however, are not about to make the cover of <em>Men&#8217;s Non-no</em>. I think it is fair to say that the &#8220;wild &amp; sexy&#8221; style is held as anathema by the tastemakers in the fashion industrial complex. O-nii-kei is basically the latest incarnation of the &#8220;<em>yankii</em>&#8221; subculture that has been the aesthetic canon for working class delinquent youth tastes since the 1970s. Although alternately romanticized and demonized in the culture at large, yankii have always existed as an outcast from the fashion industry and &#8220;proper&#8221; consumerism. O-nii-kei is in essentially the same position today. The &#8220;serious&#8221; men&#8217;s fashion magazines may take a bit of &#8220;street&#8221; style into their wardrobe authorizations, but never touch anything approximating O-nii-kei, which they generally consider &#8220;unclean.&#8221; (Although there have been rumors that struggling Takarajima publication <em>Smart</em> may take up some O-nii-kei touches&#8230;)</p>
<p>So here we have a typical problem in the Cool Industries: The actual youth subculture that is &#8220;winning&#8221; in terms of sales, growth, and momentum is ghettoized because those at the top do not personally approve of the style. In the past, bottom-up groundswells have forced magazines to realign their fashion sense to meet the changes in consumer tastes. But in most cases, those &#8220;new styles&#8221; — like Shibuya Casual (<em>shibukaji</em>) in the late &#8217;80s and Ura-Harajuku in the mid-&#8217;90s — started amongst upper middle-class youth — in other words, magazines&#8217; main consumer base. O-nii-kei, however, is so tied to a (perceived) lower class taste culture that fashion market &#8220;leaders&#8221; <em>Popeye</em> or <em>Men&#8217;s Nonno</em> could not possibly speak its language without destroying their own up-market position and credibility with advertisers (who are in reality their most important target audience). But currying mainstream magazines&#8217; favor may be a moot point. Buffalo Bobs and Vanquish haven&#8217;t needed the main fashion press to get where they are, so why start now?</p>
<p>There is a bigger question at stake, however: trend-spotters and cool-hunters have told us for the last decade that mass fashion trends trickle-down from a street-savvy &#8220;style elite,&#8221; who just happen to be very similar in tastes to the cool-hunters themselves. Now we see that this does not necessarily have to be true. There are lots of taste culture niches moving in parallel motion, and despite less social capital and cultural capital, niches at the bottom will be able to concentrate enough economic power to make the biggest splash in sluggish markets. Like with <a href="http://neomarxisme.com/wdmwordpress/?p=97" target="_blank">Akiba-kei</a>, the O-nii-kei are no longer just consumers active in their own &#8220;alternative&#8221; market: They are the only consumers consuming enough to matter!<em> </em></p>

			<p>I&#8217;d be shocked if this style was ever adopted in the West. Well, anywhere but the West Village&#8230;</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s been quite a bit of pornography-fashion overlap over the last year, and she&#8217;s the key crossover artist.</p>

			<p>Great post. I, too, am fascinated by yankii and gyaru-o styles that merge fashion and delinquency. Here&#8217;s some posts about Japanese men I&#8217;ve written recently: <a href="http://jaredinnakano.wordpress.com/category/men/" rel="nofollow">http://jaredinnakano.wordpress.com/category/men/</a>. I look forward to reading more of your posts!</p>

			<p>O-ni-kei has not replaced gyaru-o.   Gyaru-O is still quite a big style and very separate from O-ni-kei.  One friend models for Men&#8217;s Egg while my coworker models for Men&#8217;s Knuckle and if you were to actually live in Japan you could see the stark difference between the two, however many kids tend to be gyaru-o during the day and then when going to parties or working in the mizushobai biz dress the o-ni-kei part at night.</p>
<p>Gyaru-O is more bright and colorful usually.  It shares many fashion pieces as the Casual Style( such as similar boots and colorful shirts), but the obvious differences tend to be in accessories, tan skin and hair styles.  Most gyaru-o also tend to wear their clothes tighter.</p>
