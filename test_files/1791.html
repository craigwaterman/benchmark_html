			<h2>Strong land board nominations counter worst-case views of Gov. Ige</h2>
			<h4>March 18th, 2015<!-- by Ian Lind --> &middot; <a href="http://www.ilind.net/2015/03/18/strong-land-board-nominations-counter-worst-case-views-of-gov-ige/#comments">19 Comments</a></h4>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>The nomination of Carleton Ching to serve as director of DLNR goes to the Senate floor today for a final confirmation vote.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2015/CommReports/GM514_SSCR913_.htm">report of the Senate Committee on Water and Land on Governor&#8217;s Message 514</a> is long and unusually detailed, and worth reading.</p>
<p>It reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>The lack of familiarity with the subject matter of the DLNR was not surprising, given that the nominee has no job experience in the subject, nor has he volunteered for any conservation or resource projects.Â  What was surprising, however, was the nominee&#8217;s argument as to why the Committee should not be concerned with this fact, which seemed to be that the Committee members should simply trust him to follow the mission of the DLNR.<br />
Â <br />
Â Â Â Â  A nomination to the position of Chairperson of the BLNR is too important to risk to an improbable candidate having no background in conservation, environmental protection, and historic preservation.<br />
Â <br />
Â Â Â Â  Your Committee did not get a convincing impression that the nominee has an understanding of the constitutional obligations and rights that make Hawaii unique.Â  Many important day-to-day decisions that the Chairperson makes do not go before the BLNR or the CWRM for a vote.Â  These seemingly innocuous daily decisions can have an enormous impact on the public&#8217;s rights and on Hawaii&#8217;s natural, cultural, and historic resources in the short run as well as the long run.<br />
Â </p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the negative committee recommendation, I suspect the item would not have been scheduled if the necessary 13 votes had not been nailed down by the Senate leadership. That said, it may be a close vote, surprises do happen, and internal legislative dynamics are often hard to predict from the outside. We&#8217;ll see, though, in just a few hours.</p>
<p>The loud public debate over Ching&#8217;s nomination has meant <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/governor-ige-announces-three-nominations-for-board-of-land-and-natural-resources/">Governor Ige&#8217;s nominations of three members to the Board of Land and Natural Resources</a> have been largely overlooked.</p>
<p>The three are Keone Downing, Ulalia Woodside, and Chris Yuen. A small business operator, a land manager, and a Big Island attorney and farmer, as well as former county planning director and a prior land board member. </p>
<p>The nominations provide additional clues to deciphering the governor&#8217;s posture towards DLNR. Some comments left here and on other media sites have expressed the view that Ige&#8217;s choice of Ching reflects a broader &#8220;give the key to the candy store to developers&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>These nominations appear to contradict that particular narrative.</p>
<p>Each has strong credentials. All three have track records that bridge the gap between conservation and business in a manner that hasn&#8217;t raised the red flags of environmentalists in the same way that Ching did, while reflecting the &#8220;balance&#8221; that Ige and Ching have spoken of.</p>
<p>In fact, I would suspect that the selection of one of these three to serve as DNLR director, while naming Ching to a seat on the land board, would have made more sense and would have caused far less controversy.  </p>
<p>[Correction: An earlier version of this post stated, without attribution, that Ching went to intermediate school with Gov. Ige. According to Ige&#8217;s Chief of Staff, Mike McCartney, this is incorrect. They were not friends from school. I should have attributed the statement, which I saw in a post by Henry Curtis last month at his Ililani Media (&#8220;<a href="http://ililanimedia.blogspot.com/2015/02/talk-story-with-carleton-ching-and.html">Talk Story with Carleton Ching and Kekoa Kaluhiwa</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p>A further check shows that Ige graduated from high school in 1975, the same year Ching earned a degree from Boise State University. So the two would not have overlapped in either intermediate or high school. </p>
<p>My apologies for the error.]</p>

				<p>Chris Yuen is great.  I don&#8217;t know anything about the other  two nominees to the board.</p>
<p>As to Mr. Ching, and Governor Ige &#8211; well, I&#8217;ll be in the gallery of the Senate today, bracing for the likely bad news that our &#8216;collaborative&#8217; Governor has pushed the wrong person into a crucially important position, when in fact Mr. Ching could be an incredibly good resource in a different position.  Depressing.</p>
<p>(So what&#8217;s the *real* reason this is happening, the one we&#8217;re not hearing about?)</p>
<p>(And where&#8217;d the Ige I voted for vanish to?  Was he ever there?)</p>

				<p>an unexpected update, which is not unusual.</p>
<p>Star-Advertiser:<br />
Gov. David Ige withdrew Carleton Ching as his choice to lead the Department of Land and Natural Resources Wednesday, just as the full state Senate was scheduled to vote on the controversial nomination.</p>
<p>The surprise move came amid reports of a sharply divided 25-member Senate, which was under intense lobbying pressure from the governor&#8217;s office and from environmentalists opposed to Ching.</p>
<p>The Senate chamber was filled to capacity in anticipation of Wednesday&#8217;s vote, but after senators emerged from a closed-door caucus, Senate President Donna Mercado Kim reconvened the meeting and announced that Ige had withdrawn the nomination. </p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s development follows nearly two months of scrutiny and vocal opposition against Ching&#8217;s nomination to lead one of the most significant state agencies. DLNR oversees 1.3 million acres, historic sites, reserves and other resources unique to the islands.</p>
<p>The nomination of Ching, vice president of community relations for Castle &amp; Cooke Hawaii &#8212; one of the largest developers in the state &#8212; emerged as the first dramatic test of Gov. David Ige&#8217;s political determination. </p>
<p>Ige touted Ching as the best man for the job based on his integrity and his managerial experience.</p>
<p>But scores of environmental advocates, as well as members of the Senate, have questioned whether a longtime development lobbyist would best serve as the director safeguarding Hawaii&#8217;s natural resources.</p>

				<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Except that Ching went to intermediate school with Ige. These three didnâ€™t&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised at your conjecture regarding &#8220;small kid time&#8221; leading to this high level appointment.  Ching did not live his life waiting to be tapped on the shoulder by a childhood chum.   In writing this you slight his qualifications, which are significant, and you impugn the integrity of the governor and the process.  I know two of the three board nominees, and while very effective as board members they would have no chance of managing or reforming a bureaucracy the size and condition of DLNR.  In my opinion.<br />
Obviously Chings C.V. did not meet the exacting standards of a small but core group of Senators, who relied on an overwhelming (seemingly staged) outcry, from a single special interest group  (yes, that cuts both ways) called the Green/Progressive wing of the Hawaii Democratic Party.   It should be noted though that in Sen. Thielens diatribe, written as GM514, SSCR913 she writes, in conclusion;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;Your Committee also notes for the record that a development background does not disqualify someone for the position of Chairperson of BLNR/CWRM.  Indeed, a couple of the BLNR&#8217;s past Chairpersons did have work histories with Hawaii&#8217;s &#8220;Big Five&#8221; firms.  However, these individuals also had conservation and resource protection experience, including working for The Nature Conservancy and heading our State Constitutional Convention, which adopted many of the public trust responsibilities the DLNR is charged with upholding&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
Seriously, this is some major obfuscation when the examples used to &#8220;excuse&#8221;  the implied tainted work history is to have either been elected to lead ConCon (Paty) or to have done appraisals and consulted/participated with the Nature Conservancy (Young).<br />
In fact, a critical reading of this message to the Senate provides little substantive criticism and a lot of subjective responses and a lack of ideological compatibility.  </p>
<p>BUT&#8230;.Mission Accomplished!  The Gov was unable to whip up a majority, proving he&#8217;s no Frank Underwood !  That may be a good thing in the long run, but it&#8217;s hard to see any benefits to the Gov, the Department, the Senate, or the state at this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wednesday&#8217;s last minute decision to withdraw Ching&#8217;s nomination came after a backroom count resulted in 13-12 against the confirmation, according to a political insider who adds, support for Ching fell apart Tuesday night when two senators who were on the bubble changed their &#8216;yes&#8217; to a &#8216;no&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Hawaiino &#8211; you fail to have recognized the scope of citizenry who did not think Ching was the correct man for the position. Despite your personal support, many who voted in the new gov for his political independence still feel there needs to be a true reason coming from him, &#8220;why Ching?&#8221; Is Ige really the guy we voted for or does he cave to the short-term money interests?</p>

<p>Rev. Bob Nakata&#8217;s endorsement of Ching as a man who had helped unite the Waiahole residents by listening to all sides and helping mediate an agreement should have counted for a lot more in the assessment of what role Ching could have played  in leading DLNR.</p>

<p>I think I specifically identified &#8220;the scope of citizenry&#8221; as being a narrow special interest.  Reread what I wrote and see if it&#8217;s not there.<br />
If you also would take the time to review Chair Thielens committee report in which she lists the organizations that testified against the nominee.  It&#8217;s a very narrow section of the Hawaii population,  this &#8220;citizenery&#8221;.  </p>
<p>My comment about cutting both ways refers to SSCR 913&#8217;s listed support that materialized for the candidate. It too is dominated by a thematic bond, but a bit broader in scope it seemed to me. Read the list for yourself. Bu</p>
<p>In these forum postings I don&#8217;t identify myself as having an issue driven philosophical basis for my support.  I instead ask that the new Governor be granted his prerogatives and then be judged by the results. I don&#8217;t like that the candidate is characterized, demonized,  and demeaned by those practicing double standards.  </p>
<p>Which is to say Bill Aila could have never handled the range or the specificity  of questions volleyed at Ching. He&#8217;d of (perhaps) been bit more knowedgable on the issues dear to the Greens but the Waianae Harbormaster would have found management theory pretty tough,  never mind to explain an org chart,  a balance sheet,  or read a lease contract.  The Chair, at the least,   needs specific strengths or general knowledge, staff can do the rest. A Chair of a complex department like DLNR mainly requires high character,  even temprament , the trust of the Governor,  and a sense of duty.  Aila had those qualities and was duly confirmed. He was not well equipped to actually manage the Department though.</p>
<p>So,  where did Ching fail?   On specific question about issues that were actually litmus tests.  Tests he for the most part declined to take.  Why should any nominee kowtow to a committee with evident bias. </p>
<p>Go back and read what this same committee did to Peter Young about 10 years ago. What just  happened to Ching is not unusual&#8230;. and that&#8217;s  too bad.</p>

<p>Not true. First, Mr. Ching wasn&#8217;t demonized. This is a falsehood his supporters have spread, apparently believing it&#8217;s more helpful to &#8220;shoot the messengers&#8221; than it is to accept that their candidate was inadequate. On the contrary, many people who testified in opposition to the nomination at the hearing went out of their way to acknowledge his good character &amp; abilities despite the fact that he was an extremely poor fit for the DLNR directorship. What&#8217;s more, Carleton Ching had nearly two months to persuade the public and legislators that he could do the job but he failed to convince them, despite numerous coffee hours, one-on-one meetings with legislators, and who knows what else. Then, when he had the chance to respond to the WTL Committee members&#8217; questions, he failed to convince them that he could do a credible job as DLNR director. </p>
<p>Finally, in all seriousness, I&#8217;d like to hear from you supporters how Mr. Ching&#8217;s statements claiming ignorance of David Arakawa&#8217;s activities on behalf of LURF &#8212; while Mr. Ching was on the board &#8212; reflect well on Mr. Ching&#8217;s &#8220;ability to manage large organizations.&#8221;  Since I&#8217;m only &#8220;an environmentalist&#8221; who has not &#8220;distinguished myself by probity,&#8221; perhaps I just don&#8217;t get it. Please enlighten me. Mahalo.</p>

				<p>Mr. Ching WAS/HAS/IS been demonized via social media. That may be relevant or insignificant, depending on your perspective of the effects of public sentiment on very small group of legislators that were part of the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Some environmental leaders did manage to say something nice about Mr. Ching&#8217;s character. And some others took hold of the banner of &#8220;Save DLNR&#8221; with two hands to intentionally attract attention. I view the grandstanding as more for self-interest and for political gain than for any real championing of the environment.</p>

				<p>A lot of politics is about immediate gains, which is to be expected when electeds have the next election on their minds. Gov&#8217;t policy, however, is all about the long-term.  For example, we&#8217;re dealing with inefficent transportation now b/c of the politics surrounding how to fund transit improvements decades ago. Hint: improvements weren&#8217;t funded and instead we got more roads, sprawl and three routes to a part of the island that is mostly anti-growth.  I don&#8217;t have the words to articulate the insanity of those kinds of decisions.</p>

 Note that they are dominated by trusts and legacy companies that go back to the Kingdom. They pay for public interest projects like education, health care,  and numerous charities.<br />

				<p>Could not agree more with Hawaiiano.</p>
<p>Apropos in Civil Beat today is Neal Milner&#8217;s commentary about how narratives reinforce stereotypes (e.g., Waianae) and the resulting outcomes. His piece references other work that examines how we as a country arrived at residential segregation based on income. Hawaii isn&#8217;t immune to this effect and I think our high land costs just exacerbate the problems.</p>

<p>Anyway, the narrative being perpetuated that is common to Carleton Ching, DLNR, TOD and rail is how development is evil and developers (including their associated contacts) are scum. This narrative doesn&#8217;t even begin to account for what Hawaiiano mentions: that some of the big landowners in Hawaii (excluding the State) are tied to legacy trusts that have some of our poorest people as their recipients.  And social programs are funded by some revenue stream whether its our tax dollars or some retail mall in the heart of Waikiki. It&#8217;s a reality that gets almost no thorough consideration in public discourse.</p>

				<p>Responding only to the transportation facet of the conversation going on here, I have a question.</p>
<p>If the rail went to Hawaii Kai instead of the west side, and the dense transit-oriented development/redevelopment that rail is used to justify went there with it, would people currently living in Hawaii Kai end up with longer or shorter drive times to work?</p>
<p>People from West Oahu don&#8217;t like spending roughly an extra hour in traffic every day any more than people from other parts of Oahu would. We&#8217;re just, for whatever reason, more vulnerable to deception than the rest of the island.</p>
<p>Our current transportation plan is what happens when one group of humans senses weakness in another. Massive inequality.</p>

				<p>Interesting framing of a question about transportation inequity. </p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say that East Oahu was slated to have a &gt; 150K population like west Oahu. (I think the population currently hovers around 50K.)</p>
<p>Traffic via the one route to town could very well be over an hour and maybe Hawaii Kai people would be getting up at 4:30 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Would east-side people then be clamoring for a transportation alternative?</p>
<p>I think yes, but since we&#8217;re talking hypotheticals, you can create whatever answer you want based on your view of human tendencies.</p>
