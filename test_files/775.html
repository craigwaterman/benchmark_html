<p><strong>GURU PURNIMA &#8211; BATH IN THE BLUE MOON</strong></p>
<p>Today is actually the most auspicious day in the Vedic calender. It is yogic Christmas really. As the full (blue) moon draws closer to the earth during July we are able to bathe in the light of the feminine and receive warmth, clearing of our karma and a special blessing.</p>
<p>So tonight if you are able meditate, light a candle and walk in the light of this rare second full moon of July &#8211; it will be full at 8.42pm. It&#8217;s best if you meditate and connect with the teacher within your own heart and then make an offering of flowers at an alter or picture of your teachers, or perhaps to the ocean or just internally your heart. It is a day to give thanks to all who have gone before us and who have helped us to see the light and beauty of our being.</p>
<p>After you do all this then you get to make a wish &#8211; a wish that will expand both yours and the whole universe&#8217;s state of happiness &#8211; Guru Purnima grants you a boon.</p>
<p>Tonight I will pray and thank of all my teachers but I also want to thank each one of you who have shared with me over the years. She Births has only arisen and become so successful because of our very special community and the open dialogue we share. I am so grateful for every birth I have attended and every story that you have shared via email, facebook or at yoga. I must say that today I feel incredibly connected to all of you who I have had the privilege to teach and share with.</p>

<p><strong>HELP INSPIRE OTHERS WITH OUR NEW SHE BIRTHS FILM</strong><br />
We are making new She Births DVD over the next couple of weeks. It will be used in our She Births courses on the Saturday afternoons. I would love it to be a montage of different images and videos &#8211; from different couples giving birth in different places and in different ways. But of course showing all the tools we utilise and the deep trust and support needed for birth. If you have any video footage (or stills) that you would be happy to share with other pregnant couples then <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7d9d6d3ded9d2f7c4dfd2d5dec5c3dfc499d4d8da88c4c2d5ddd2d4c38ae4dfd2928587f5dec5c3dfc4928587f1dedbda" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:nadine@shebirths.com?subject=She%20Births%20Film">please send me an email directly here.</a></p>

<p><strong>DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT SHE BIRTHS EDUCATOR?</strong><br />
I ran a Join the Revolution of Birth workshop the other week &#8211; which just happened to fall on Bastille Day -I do love how the universe works sometimes. When I realised the day &#8211; which was that morning thanks to facebook &#8211; my words came out a little something like this&#8230;(read more here)</p>
<p>I did not know when I started working with birth that I was joining a revolution. I didn&#8217;t realise that birth was a movement. And was embedded with politics. I saw the politics pretty quickly as it plays out in hospital systems &#8211; as it does in nearly all large bureaucracies. But I had no idea how deeply the rivers of intrinsic power and empowerment run within birth. Read more here&#8230;</p>
<p>As time goes on I learn more and more about birth and the potential empowerment or disempowerment the moment can hold for women both in the west and in the 3rd world. I still struggle to get my head around the face that women are the most disadvantaged and mistreated group of people on the planet.</p>
<p>So being a part of She Births or by becoming an educator, doula, midwife, ob you really are a big part of the revolution whether you know it or like it, or not.</p>
<p>The goal of She Births® is to support couples to give birth as consciously and as lovingly as possible. Every one of our educators feels this and is also a very skilled facilitator, teacher, birth worker. She builds a business by creating a community and offering numerous services from pregnancy to postpartum and creates a unique worthiness amongst our mums, a validation of families that they truly are making a huge difference simply in the valuing and loving relationships they foster.</p>
<p>There are only 2 spaces left for the 2015 Educator Training program on 7-11th September. Read more from our Manly <a href="http://shebirths.com/educators-around-world/become-educator/">She Births® Educator Radha Vine here and learn about the comprehensive training.</a></p>

<p>If this sounds like you, or someone else you know, then don&#8217;t miss out on the new <strong>one day </strong><a href="http://shebirths.com/event/becoming-a-part-of-the-birthing-revolution/">Becoming a Part of the Childbirth Revolution </a>workshop.</p>
<p>After many requests I am finally holding a one day workshop for those of you interested in learning more about the <strong>She Births® Educator Program</strong>. Come along and get all of your questions answered and learn more about the unique She Births® system and the role it plays in our global childbirth revolution.<br />
<a href="http://shebirths.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/she-births-course.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-64596 aligncenter" src="http://shebirths.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/she-births-course-300x200.jpg" alt="she births course" width="300" height="200" /></a><br />
I have created an amazing list of topics and discussions for the day that will be <strong>informative, interactive and inspiring</strong>. More and more, as the years go on I see continually how independent childbirth education is key to empowerment for our pregnant couples.</p>
<p>Our She Births® tag line &#8211; Empowerment through Education says it all but it doesn&#8217;t just apply to childbirth &#8211; it is for all of us who long to grow, change and develop.<br />
<strong><em>Without knowing the choices you have,<br />
how can you ever find the path that is right for you?<br />
Without making a conscious choice,<br />
how can you ever feel fully empowered?</em></strong><br />
She Births® is one part of a new wave for birth on our planet. She Births® <strong>transforms</strong>, <strong>enlightens</strong>, <strong>inspires</strong> and offers a depth of <strong>connection</strong>, <strong>intuition</strong> and <strong>empowerment</strong> like no other. This is what truly changes the experience of childbirth for women, men and babies. This is what allows a woman to birth herself as the mother she needs to be for her newborn child.</p>
<p>Spaces are limited so grab your spot now for only $79. You can read more about the topics we will discuss here &#8211; <a href="http://shebirths.com/event/becoming-a-part-of-the-birthing-revolution/">Becoming a Part of the Childbirth Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>If you are out of town and can&#8217;t fly in then create a small group of interested people and I might be able to come to you! The Birthing Institute is looking to expand into <strong>Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Byron Bay and the Gold Coast</strong>. (Oh and I just got a call from Lausanne, <strong>Switzerland</strong> wanting an educator training this year too&#8230; So <strong>France</strong> and <strong>England</strong> let me know also!)</p>

However, today I really want to share a most inspiring story of how things can change with birth from one extreme to the other very quickly &#8211; and with the right kind of education and support. It&#8217;s just one of the reasons why I love what I do, and why I keep on doing it everyday.</p>
<p>Over April and May we have celebrated Midwives day, Mother&#8217;s Day and my 40th birthday. I&#8217;ve written and spoken as a birth expert in international magazines and summits. More links in my next newsletter but as so many of you ask how I created She BIrths® etc maybe you would like to read this <a href="http://flowerchild.com.au/ourblog/inspirational-monday-meet-nadine-from-she-births/">short Q&amp;A piece on Flowerchild</a>. and I was honoured to present at the Yoga Australia conference speaking about the power of prenatal yoga and childbirth as pathway to enlightenment.</p>
<p>My new She Births® educators are also now offering courses in <a href="http://shebirths.com/find-educator/">Redfern, Maroubra, Manly, Zurich &#8211; Switzerland and London &#8211; England.</a> And this week a new educator has joined our team to launch She Births® in Melbourne. Woo hoo!</p>
<p>Any pregnant friends can catch me at my monthly talks: <a href="http://www.billabongretreat.com.au/event_cat/pre-natal-program/">The Three Pillars to Creating a Beautiful Birth Experience &#8211; held at the beauitful yoga retreat space, Billabong</a> &#8211; next course and retreat is on Tuesday 28th May. Or, if you would like to hear how She Births® can help you avoid a medical induction and make birth safer then <a href="http://shebirths.com/free-talks/">tune in to my recent radio interview with Dr. Jason Kaplan on 2UE here</a>.</p>
<p>But, firstly, let me tell you a story&#8230;because it was an amazing turn of events that happened to me and a She Births® mum just last week.</p>
<p>It started with an email from England &#8211; Evelyn, who had her first baby 2 years ago with She Births®. She wrote and asked me if she could wear her She Births® Belly Belt after a c-section. I said of course and remembered that Evelyn gave birth to her first son in the water at our local birth centre here in Randwick, Sydney.</p>
<p>I gently inquired into why a c-section was being scheduled for her this time and asked if she needed any resources to help make her birth family centred and immune boosting for her baby. She told me that her new little one was in the 90th percentile for growth and that her caregivers advice was that in order to avoid any shoulder dystocia they would prefer to do a c-section over the usual medical  protocol which is to induce. There was the added risk of her being just over 40 years old this time too.</p>
<p>I revised with Eveyln all of our natural induction techniques for labour to help prime her hormones for bonding and breastfeeding as well went over our new immune boosting family centred c-section protocol. Because Evelyn said to me that she was not feeling 100% comfortable with the decision I encouraged her simply to ask a few more questions of her caregiver and potentially ask for a second opinion too. This I have found is so key to post birth satisfaction and really allows a woman to understand fully and accept an outcome.</p>
<p>As I dug a little deeper though I realised that Evelyn&#8217;s family had been traumatised by the loss of a friend&#8217;s baby during birth many years ago. And, the hospital she was attending had also experienced an incident recently; the result of shoulder dislodgement. I suggested Evelyn also read an essay in the new book; <a href="http://www.pinterandmartin.com/the-roar-behind-the-silence.html">The Roar Behind the Silence</a> that speaks clearly about the impact one negative or traumatic birth can have on the psyche of a caregiver and the system &#8211; and I wished her all the best.</p>
<p>Two days later I received this email&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Nadine, I had to let you know that I saw another consultant this morning about an hour before my c-section was scheduled. He agreed to induce me and my lovely 10lb baby boy was delivered within an hour and half &#8211; no stitches, no pain relief and one very very happy mamma !!! Thank you so much Xxxxxx &#8221;</p>
<p>This for me is a wonderful story because it really highlights the key role of an educator in supporting mums and the importance of questioning until we feel complete with answers. Educators and doulas are not doctors and we do not ever give advice, but we care after the hearts and minds of our women and complement our amazing hospital safety net systems. We offer ideas and suggestions only to help a couple make the deicsion that is best for them and their baby with a caregiver. Evelyn was prepared for both outcomes. I know that without education a woman cannot be prepared. And without choices a woman will never feel empowered.</p>
<p>This story brings me back to my mission for She Births® which is to make every birth beautiful, no matter what unfolds.</p>
<p>I have recently begun offering birth debriefing sessions to couples because I know it can be very hard to understand why birth has unfolded the way it has, and to come to terms with it too. There are a multitude of complexities that come into  play during birth and without many years of experience it is impossible to understand what happened and why. But without peace around our birth experiences it can be hard to also conceive and feel proud of ourselves as women. You are welcome to be in touch and make an appointment if you need.</p>
<p>Lots of love,</p>
<p>Nadine xxx</p>

<p>If you are reading this blog then I know you agree with me &#8211;  childbirth can be one of the most beautiful and sacred events in our lives. And, it remains a topic of conversation for all women, whether pregnant, early post partum or even a grandmother.</p>
<p>Birth is an event that we never forget. I remember, just like it was yesterday giving birth to my son Leroy &#8211; and that was 13 years ago!</p>
<p>One of the things I love most about working with birth is the complexities and the continual learning. It is a niche, rather like yoga that is a couple of metres wide yet infinite in depth. As the body-mind is so complex within all of us there is always more to learn from this very simple and everyday event.</p>
<p>I attended a homebirth the other day and learnt so much again; about the intricacies of malposition, the nature of trust and how deep it needs to run for everyone present &#8211; not just the mum &#8211; in order for birth to unfold naturally.</p>
<p>When I hear the average person in the street talking about birth I am still amazed by the negativity and misconceptions discussed and firmly held as though they are THE truth. I believe we still, i.e. all of us including me, have so much more to learn about birth. And just becaue you have expereinced birth one particular way, does not make you an expert &#8211; so please remember that the next time you discuss your birth or someone in the shopping ailse pulls you over to debrief their experience remember this!</p>
<p>That is why today I have a really exciting summit I want to share with you. I highly recommend that you join me at this online event in 10 days time.</p>
<p>Dr. Sandra Bevacqua invited me to present on <a title="Empowered Birth Summit" href="https://www.secureinfossl.com/affProgram/The-Empowered-Mothers-Summit/90494">The Empowered Mother&#8217;s Guide to a Happy, Healthy, Holistic Birthing Experience</a> and I knew I had to be a part of it. She is an expert on the female pelvis, pelvic floor and sexuality as well as being a doctor of Molecular and Cellular Biology with additional expertise in Genetic Engineering, Nutrition and Human Biology. Her work is mind blowing! Dr. Sandy has a 9 month program helping women reclaim their power as they recover from prolapse, incontinence and sexual pain with her ground breaking knowledge and unique exercise programs. To say she is an expert is putting it mildly.</p>
<p>I have joined her and other like-minded childbirth experts like Debra Pascali-Boraro, Susun Weed, Katrina Zaslavsky and Stephanie Dawn at the summit. You won&#8217;t want to miss it! You can reserve your space here now.</p>
<p>I hope you can join us for five days of ground breaking, thought provoking discussion on how you can create an empowering birth experience&#8230;and how you can learn more about birth if you have already had your children. In the summit you will</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how you can transform pain to pleasure</li>
<li>Understand the anatomy, physiology and psychology of giving birth</li>
<li>Find out how to protect your pelvic floor</li>
<li>Acquire tools to address your fears and move through blocks</li>
<li>Discover how to have an orgasmic birth</li>
<li>Learn which herbs can be used safely during pregnancy and childbirth</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots more!<br />
All you need to do to reserve your spot for <a href="https://www.secureinfossl.com/affProgram/The-Empowered-Mothers-Summit/90494">The Empowered Mother&#8217;s Guide to a Happy, Healthy, Holistic Birthing Experience, May 4th thru 8th is reserve your spot here.</a></p>
<p>There are some fantastic specials and upgrade discounts too &#8211; you will even receive 20% off the She Births® online course.</p>
<p>Remember to pass this on to a friend if you can and I hope to see you then<br />

It’s called <a href="https://lb135.isrefer.com/go/bumpsbirthsbabies/Nadine/" target="_blank">Bumps, Birth and Babies – Holistic Health Conference</a> and it’s run by the Red Tent Mums, who are Chinese medicine practitioners with a strong focus on pregnancy, birth, children and women’s health.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn and all the seminars are accessible online &#8211; so it’s just a case of signing up and logging on! I’ll be speaking about the <strong>3 Pillars to creating a safer, shorter and more beautiful birth </strong>alongside some other fabulous experts such as Dr Sarah Buckley, Debra Pascali Bonaro and Pinky McKay. You’ll be able to choose from topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orgasmic Birth – Moving from Pain to Power</li>
<li>Prepping Dads for Birth</li>
<li>How to Get your Mojo Back after Baby</li>
</ul>
<p>… and so much more.</p>
<p>All of the <a href="https://lb135.isrefer.com/go/bumpsbirthsbabies/Nadine/" target="_blank">info is available here</a>. Once you’ve signed up for free, you’ll be able to listen to as many of the talks as you like. Transcripts and audio will then be available for purchase should you wish to keep them. I’m super excited about this conference and also the upcoming <strong>Yoga Australia Conference</strong> being held on <strong>Sunday 22nd March</strong>.</p>
<p>I will be talking about one of my DEEPEST PASSSIONS&#8230;.<strong>Childbirth as a Vedic rite of passage</strong>. The theme for this year&#8217;s conference is the <strong>8 limbs of yoga</strong>.  As you may already know yoga is not really about creating pretzel shapes with our bodies, but rather settling the mind and expanding our consciousness so we can move further into a state of <strong>enlightenment</strong> and <strong>ahimsa</strong> (non-violence).</p>
<p>I will be sharing how with the right preparation, knowledge and tools childbirth can be one of the most <strong>evolving</strong> experiences of our lives.  A <strong>sacred rite of passage</strong> that has the opportunity to expand our consciousness, <strong>enlighten</strong> our hearts and minds, and <strong>teach us about the very cornerstones of love..the essence of yoga.</strong></p>
<div><em>I hope you can join me at one or both conferences!</em></div>

<p class="entry-meta">by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://shebirths.com/author/nadine/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Nadine Richardson</span></a></span> on <time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2015-02-20T10:25:15+00:00">February 20, 2015</time> </p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Another year has passed and it&#8217;s a great time to pause and <strong>reflect</strong>. To consider what we are grateful for and the challenges we have overcome. What joys have been shared and what lessons have been learnt.</p>
<p>There are 3 things that I learnt and <strong>know for sure</strong>, from this year&#8217;s triumphs and tribulations. I hope you find meaning in them and they help you create some amazing goals for 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Number one is Healthy attachment creates awesome kids</strong></p>
<p>My 12 year old boy, Leroy started at the local highschool this year. And I have to say that I was secretly a nervous wreck about it! But, it has turned out to be completley fine. And perhaps even more than fine&#8230;really <strong>beautiful</strong> to observe.</p>
<p>The year is a massive transition for every child and <strong>exposure</strong> to knowledge about drugs, sex, bullying is way beyond what you and I ever knew about. Leroy has been able to express what&#8217;s going on for him and share and I have been able to give him the space that he needs to find his own feelings too. He has demonstrating to me so clearly that I can keep trusting him and let him go. He has been able to navigate his way through school; scan and search out who is a genuine friend, who are those he needs to protect and who are those to steer clear of in a concillatory way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like I always heard my mum say &#8216;values are inherent and come from our loving families&#8217;. So my guidance to you all is this &#8211; love them as much as you can. Hug them, kiss them, say &#8216;i love you&#8217; at any opportunity because they will pretty much be gone to the world by the time Year 7 comes around. And your only way to live on ith them will be inside their hearts as a little <strong>compass</strong> and deep sense of <strong>worthiness</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Number two is Dream as big as you can. </strong></p>
<p>A very wise spiritual teacher once said to me &#8211; If the universe is not supporting you it&#8217;s becuase you are thinking too <strong>little</strong> of yourself and your vision is too <strong>small</strong>. I encourage you to really test this one out for yourself in 2015. You may be amazed but what happens, as I was.</p>
<p>I have held back for a long time from making She Births bigger &#8211; mainly afraid of dilution and concerned about working more. Interestingly, this year I had begun to watch my business started to suffer within that <strong>frame of mind</strong>. So one night in August I decided to bite the bullet, embrace my fears and grow the business as big as I can. And make it the &#8216;go to&#8217; course for every woman in the world. The next day amazing things started to happen &#8211; phone calls, emails, associates got in contact with me etc&#8230;All in support of a new visionary growth. Amazing people turned up, just out of the blue, as though the universe had heard my <strong>internal declaration</strong>&#8230;which of course it had! And it has set the wheels in motion for some really exciting and groundbreaking projects with some amazing teams of people.</p>
<p>So my second lesson to you is dream bigger and farther than you have ever done before. You won&#8217;t have to do it all yourself, because your inspiration and passion will draw the right people to you for the perfect type of support. Which takes us to the third thing I know for sure&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Number three is Passion and persistence pay off.</strong></p>
<p>My drive to make the world a better place for mums and babies and new families is on the cusp of <strong>worldwide</strong> <strong>accolade</strong> this year. If it wasn&#8217;t for that deep <strong>desire</strong> to find absolutely every possible cause of pain and pain relief for example &#8211; solutions would never have been found. If I didn&#8217;t want to help make every birth a beautiful and <strong>bonding</strong> experience then I certainly would never have created the holisitic and comprehensive She Births® course.</p>
<p>In backing myself, in dreaming big and in persisting amazing things have happened. Perhaps this is all part of gettting close to turning 40 and knowing who I really am or perhaps it was all written in the stars. I like to think however, that I have had a role to play in <strong>stepping up</strong> and meeting the world this year, in greeting it consciously with love and acceptance, with knowledge and humility.</p>
<p>I am forever <strong>grateful</strong> for those who inspire, educate and support me in my journey &#8211; my family, friends, colleagues and students. And I love the fact that the line between these 4 wonderful groups of people is continually becoming more blurred.</p>
<p>2015 is going to be a <strong>huge</strong> year for us all I&#8217;m sure. I hope your journey is blessed with love and light and that we continue to walk this path together as a supportive <strong>community</strong> creating more beautiful births, more loving families and a more peaceful place for all.</p>
<p>Big love to you and your loved ones,</p>
<p>xxx Nadine</p>

<p>How much do you miss your prenatal yoga classes? They are the best classes ever right&#8230;and so tricky to get to with a <strong>second</strong> or third bub or with a regular <strong>corporate</strong> job.</p>
<p>I have been so <strong>blessed</strong> over the years with the most wonderful students. You are the reason and the drive behind me creating She Births®&#8230;all the stories and the <strong>transformations</strong> I&#8217;ve seen have been amazing. I love how the Shala students are just so intelligent and health conscious and aspiring to grow not just in physical ways but also spiritually too. So&#8230;</p>
<div><strong>I am very excited to share that starting next Thursday 13th November we have a new Prenatal Yoga class: 6-7.15pm at The Dharma Shala. </strong></div>
<p>Please feel free to come along if you are looking for a more <strong>relaxing</strong>, feminine, nurturing type class or if you are struggling with <strong>injuries</strong> that restrict you in general classes.</p>
<p>You are also welcome at this class to bring along your <strong>partners</strong> (although they may want to hide up the back 😉 they will still love it and we will put in some <strong>active</strong> birthing or <strong>rebozo</strong> techniques if they join that night.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my latest interview with the lovely and inspiring Jacinta Tynan at <a href="http://motherzen.com/" target="_blank">Mother Zen</a> &#8211; We titled it:<strong> You have a choice in the way you experience parenthood </strong>&#8211; I hope you enjoy and have a good cry like I did. xxx</p>

<p>We all know that it takes a village to raise a child. And I am a huge advocate for shared living and shared parenting (currently think that a Multiple Occupancy dwelling in Bondi would be great while I enjoy my dear friends visiting from India). I believe that collectively we can create a beautiful world for our children that is sustainable and gentle and inspiring&#8230;and these 3 events certainly add to that idea and help make it a reality.</p>
<p>Here are my ways for our little community to come together and collectivley learn and grow and support one another before we close 2014.<br />

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to share a video blog with you this month. There is so much to share from our travels in Tonga and swimming with the whales&#8230;I would love to hold a retreat there with some yogis one year. My video is not perfect, but it&#8217;s a start so I hope you&#8217;ll forgive my editing skills.</p>
<p>One of the best things about our holiday was that I had absolutley no contact with my phone, email or facebook! As a result both Leroy and I both felt like we had been away for a whole month. Secondly, I have not been promoting my She Births courses lately as it&#8217;s been so busy training the new educators and building the new website.</p>
<p>So, if you know anyone &#8216;up the duff&#8217; and you want to save them from wasting their money on hospital courses or other courses that are no where near as powerful or comprehensive as us&#8230;Then please let them know I will be giving the transformational and enlightening talk: THE 3 ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS TO CREATING A BEAUTIFUL BIRTH EXPERIENCE this Saturday at 1.30pm &#8211; See here for info.</p>
<p>If anyone books in for these 2 course dates I will give them a special gift valued at $100: OCTOBER 25/26 &amp; a brand new course date NOVEMBER 8/9. Remember you only need to be around 22 weeks to take the course&#8230;and the earlier the better always.</p>
