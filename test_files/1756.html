	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I had my now regular health check up at my gym last Tuesday. This time they had a new machine and gadgets so that they could measure more accurately and some other things. I had my blood pressure tested and then my peak flow in which you blow into a tube three times and they take an average. I got better by the third and averaged 500. Apparently 635 in normal value for my age/height. This was put down to my long distance fitness and how I improve the more I go on.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-324" src="https://whisperisms.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/cultivating-mass.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="cultivating-mass" width="200" height="300">I then stood on a fancy set of scales barefoot as this was the new body stat testing machine. The results came through on a till like receipt. I was horrified to find out I&#8217;d put on weight. I retorted by exclaiming, &#8220;dude! I&#8217;m not fat I&#8217;m cultivating mass!&#8221;. I was told to calm down and the stats were explained. Even though I had put on about 4kg since the last test, I had reduced my body fat from 8% to 6.4%. I had increased weight by putting on lean muscle which was the goal of my gym programme so this was proof that it was working.</p>
<p>This new fancy test also measured some new stats. The first was my metabolic age which was 21. &#8220;Metabolic age describes the relationship between your body composition and BMR measurements. Ideally, your metabolic age should be equal to or less than your biological age. You will see your metabolic age decrease as your body composition improves.&#8221; Not bad for a 36 year old. The other was my visceral fat which out of a score of 13 was 1. This was apparently the best score possible and I was the only so far to get it.&nbsp; &#8220;Visceral fat is the body fat that is stored in the abdominal cavity. Carrying excess body fat in the abdominal area places you at greater risk for chronic diseases including heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. For optimal health, your visceral fat rating should stay under 13.&#8221; So I was happy with that. The other new one was a degree of obesity. I got -16 which means I have that much chance of becoming obese. That was probably obvious.</p>
<p>So over the three tests (see table below) I&#8217;ve had I have shown considerable improvement each time. It&#8217;s progress against my goals and reward for my hard work and discipline. I aim to have another one in April when in theory I should be at my peak just before the Boston Marathon.</p>

<h3>Training update</h3>
<p>After last week&#8217;s 65 miles I was contemplating reaching 70 this week. I had an intense lactate threshold session on Tuesday which went well and I ran 16 miles on Wednesday, with 8 of those at a fast pace with the club. The plan to just go for distance was yet again thwarted by the ever continuing fast pace of the first group. Was a great workout but my legs (a leg gym session on Monday added in) were a bit heavy so I decided to rest them on Thursday and just do an upper body gym session.&nbsp; I went on a 9 mile run before work on Friday and then had the final Surrey League Division 2 match at Lloyd Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>It was a cold and wet day and we were staring relegation in the face. I just wanted to get it out of the way and yet again managed to have my shoe come off not once but twice. I had to stop to tie them up properly which with cold hands is not easy. In the end I just wanted to get around without injury with the bigger picture of Boston and London playing on my mind. There were however some great performances from the other Striders including Pete who won it outright (first Strider to do so) and James who came third even though he had been ill for a week demonstrating a great dedication to the cause. However we were still relegated. On the upside, with this team the future is bright and we have a great chance for bouncing straight back up again.</p>
<p>Today was the Ladywell 17 club training run. A route I&#8217;ve done a few times recently but James and I wanted to do a bit extra so went off after the first half to add some extra miles. We intended to go to Greenwich and head back but James thought that would be boring so suggested running to London and take the train back. A smashing idea as we ended up finding a new route through New Cross, Peckham, Camberwell through to the Oval and Vauxhall. We continued up the river and finished at London Bridge completing 19/20 miles. So 65 miles done again and a new long route which I could use to run to and from work discovered.</p>
<p>I now have a couple of weeks off marathon training as I prepare for back to back half marathons starting with Wokingham next Sunday (21st) and Brighton on 28th. A kind of mini test for two full marathons in six days. Next week&#8217;s half marathon will be a true indicator of where I am in my training and race readiness. It&#8217;s also a chance to go home and see the folks and more importantly put in my home cooking order. It&#8217;s also a bonus that Pete and Krzysztof from the club will be running Wokingham and a few others including James will be running Brighton.</p>
<h3>5 before 6</h3>
<p>You may have seen in my blog post, <a href="https://wordpress.com/post/whisperisms.wordpress.com/23">&#8216;Don&#8217;t hate the playlist&#8230;&#8217;</a>&nbsp; where I talked about, &#8220;Being an early riser the Chris Hawkins show (on BBC 6 Music) which starts at 5am&#8230;he has something called ‘5 before 6’ where someone suggests five songs to be played throughout the week saying why they’re significant to them.&#8221; Well I was told on Thursday that I was successful and starting from tomorrow I will be their &#8216;DJ&#8217; all week with a song I&#8217;ve chosen being played at 0555. As I said it&#8217;s based around a running theme so tune daily in to see what I&#8217;ve chosen and why. You will also be able to catch up with it on iPlayer if that&#8217;s too early for you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I ran a splendid 21 mile scenic, speedy, and sunny run today around Kingston and Hampton Court Palace. The muddy and hilly club run didn&#8217;t appeal for some reason. I was joined by my running buddy Simone who is also doing Boston this year. James who showed us this route (the classic Lidl breakfast run) was unable to join us due to illness. It&#8217;s pretty much two 8 mile laps which takes you across the river and past Hampton Cout Palace. Simone who&#8217;s coming back from a foot injury (but looked good today) stopped after about two laps or 16 miles and I carried on to complete the higher distance which was my target.</p>
<p>Now this in itself isn&#8217;t that strange as it&#8217;s standard marathon training for me now. What was strange was on my finishing straight around 20 miles I was cruising along at a good pace when I saw two runners coming the other way. Again that itself isn&#8217;t strange as we encountered many runners this morning along this route. Pretty standard. What made these two stand out and make me double take was that they were tethered together. Again this isn&#8217;t that strange as these are used for visually impaired runners who need someone to run with them as a guide. It&#8217;s a good way to keep them together and they manage to find a symbiosis that means they compliment each other well. However, from what I could see neither were visually impaired and it seemed it was a way for them as a couple to run together. Now this takes doing EVERYTHING together to a whole new freaky level doesn&#8217;t it? Neither can run away from each other and you&#8217;re married to the other one&#8217;s speed. Surely that&#8217;s frustrating if you start to feel good and want to speed up and open those legs. You&#8217;d have to rely on the other one to match that or you&#8217;d end up dragging them along like a dog on a leash. Which I also witnessed today. Anyway. Each to their own. Different strokes and all that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)<br />
Feeling like I have no release. (So do I)<br />
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)<br />
Nothing in my life is free&#8230; is free</p></blockquote>
<p>My aim was to do 21 miles today and thanks to Simone I was able to run it quite easily in the end at a decent pace. I was in need of a flat, fast paced long run as I&#8217;ve been a bit too stop and it&#8217;s been quite frustrating. I&#8217;ve missed running with Simone and my other main marathon training buddy James. Hopefully we&#8217;ll all be back to fitness and wellness by next week to run together again. Also with some added buddies in Pete, Taric, Phil and maybe that traitor Ernie and push ourselves to the next level.</p>
<p>That makes it 65 miles this week and puts me on course to be on 70 miles soon. Therefore, after all those miles I was happy to feel comfortable at this distance and it&#8217;s not mid-Feb yet. Also it was pleasing as my hip problem seems to be under control and will all the miles this week it held up well today. That could be down to continuing treatment by the osteopath, constant strength work, stretching and foam rolling of the troublesome areas. Or running a nice flat route with a good running partner. Or the sunshine. Or those that gels I had.</p>
<p>Who freakin&#8217; knows but I&#8217;m feeling better as I progress and that goal of Boston and London doesn&#8217;t seem as daunting. Still a long way to go plenty more miles and three half marathons in between but I&#8217;m actually looking forward to it all now. You&#8217;re probably thinking I&#8217;m as big a freak as those tethered runners. You bet your bottom dollar I am.</p>

		<p>I’ve tried to avoid using it as it means that if I say it I acknowledge it. The word can affect your state of mind and our attitude towards running motivation. After Amsterdam and before Christmas I started running again but not under the pretence of that particular word. It can take its toll doing it twice a year. Two 12 week (minimum) cycles of mile counting means it can become a chore. So I was just running for the fun of it, to keep some fitness up and to get rid of any creaks from the last marathon.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s the new year I am now officially in that mode. However, my start has been hampered by issues with my left hip and adductor which has affected my speed and ability to run long distances. My goal to be up to over 60 miles by now hasn’t quite materialised as a result  yet but I hope to get close to it this week.</p>
<h3>Hold me now&#8230;</h3>
<p>The frustration of not being able to keep up in long runs or fading significantly towards the end as it tightened up and my right glute tightened to compensate led me to see the osteopath who works out of the RCJ. He kindly offered to assess me for free and to ascertain whether he could help me or not. An assessment suggested that the top of my tendon is sore and potentially inflamed which was restricting the movement of that hip. He did some work on it which was really quite painful even though I have a pain threshold. He also noticed a previous problem I had of tightness in my lower back so snapped it. Sounds bad doesn&#8217;t it? I remember the first time I had that done by a final year student and I was given the disclaimer that &#8220;you will hear some cracks (that’s perfectly normal) but there is a chance, a very small one mind, that it could go wrong and there could be some damage. Are you OK to go ahead?&#8221; &#8220;Oh sure. What could go wrong? Crack on&#8221; (no pun intended). I&#8217;ll tell you what. There&#8217;s nothing more reassuring than being held in the foetal position by a student while he does the old hug and roll a few times and then snaps your back. The osteopath at work though had done numerous ones before and so it was performed impeccably.</p>
<h3>Crossed country</h3>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_128" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" size-full wp-image-128 alignright" src="https://whisperisms.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/blog-bad-ankle.jpg?w=648" alt="blog-bad-ankle"   /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">THAT ankle pic from Parliament Hills last year. Twisted, spiked and muddy. The hat trick.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So did it help? The first real test was the important Surrey Cross Country Division 2 league match at Reigate Priory last Saturday where for the first time in years Striders faced the possibility of being relegated. The “big guns” who could not make the first two races (there are four in a season) came out for this all important tie. The question was what footwear to run in: 15mm spikes? 12mm spikes? Trail shoes? The weather had been chilly after a period of rain but it was rather pleasant with sun shining in the build up to the race. This meant a lot of the ground had dried up and a warm up around some of the course showed a mix of paths, gravel, mud and hard ground. Long spikes were not a good idea. So ideal weather conditions overall, but how did we fare? We stormed at the front with 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> place overall but relegation seemed all the more likely (barring a miracle) after the last match in Croydon in a couple of weeks time. Runners carrying injuries, or being injured on the course paid its toll and particularly in my case, the hip, adductor and tight glute prevented any kind of speed. I found it tough and it was the first Cross Country I’d done in a year. The last time I ran was at Parliament Hill where I twisted my ankle, lost the bottom of my shoe and for good measure had someone’s spikes go into same twisted ankle. I finished but it added to yet another horrific XC experience. I have yet to truly master or fall in love with it but I’ll battle on, especially with Strider pride at stake in the final fixture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test after a XC is can you make it for the long run Sunday morning? After the customary team building post-race drinks four of us resolved to meet (after some negotiation) at 9am the next morning to run at least 15 miles which I managed while some ran 21-22 miles showing how far I am behind.</p>
<p>I gave myself two days rest due to trying to fight off a cold. I had successfully completed a year at my new job without a single day off sick and I would be damned if I would get ill now. So far I’ve been winning and managed 35 miles this week with 18-20 more planned before Sunday. The hip performed well on Wednesday morning and I had my first unrestricted run in awhile. It was truly liberating and I flew around the 9.5 miles peaking at sub-6 minute which I hadn’t done since before Amsterdam. A sports massage on Wednesday worked the problems areas some more but was really quite painful. The sessions over the last couple of years have generally been for maintenance and minor complaints but this is the first time in a while I’ve had a potentially major problem. I’m usually quite Zen and relaxed after but this time my pain threshold was really put to the test and it was at times traumatic. Our normally pleasant and symbiotic relationship was put to the test. But we survived. I ran on the treadmill on Thursday and out around the parks before work on Friday but the problem has come back. I managed 8 miles today but more of a struggle than yesterday. It could be down to the severe massage work or accumulation of miles.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s long run will be a challenge but will see how it goes. I have become close friends with my new foam roller acquired at Christmas and on the recommendation of the osteopath a newly acquired hot water bottle. There will be lots of prescribed stretching, strength exercises, hot baths, etc to get me through. Oh training. How I missed thee…</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>What I wanted to say in this post has changed a few times since Friday. A night out with the inspiration for this &#8211; and the reason why I&#8217;m running two marathons &#8211; is what drove it, but then discovering about events in Paris on the way home changed it a bit, and then receiving extremely sad news yesterday changed it again.</p>
<p>On Friday I met up with my friend who I ran the Auckland marathon for last year. I wanted to do it for charity so she had chosen Cancer Research UK and I was able to, thanks to so many generous people, raise money for it and feel like I was doing something useful to help. I suppose that&#8217;s the thing when you hear such news, you feel a sense of helplessness and that you can&#8217;t do anything even though you want to so much. I know how to run marathons so this is what I had chosen to do for her and also for some other good friends who had close relatives fighting cancer as well. The Auckland marathon was a special one because of where it was but also because I had a reason other than for myself to get through. Towards the end I struggled as jet lag, an early start, the heat, or whatever took its toll. Maybe I might have stopped in other circumstances but what kept me going was I was doing it for my friends, for the loved ones of others, and I drove myself across the finish line as I didn&#8217;t want to let them down.</p>
<p>Devastatingly my other friends loved ones have since passed, and that sense of helplessness only magnified. Also this irrational sense of guilt that my friend was OK and made it but theirs didn&#8217;t. She had been through a lot after being diagnosed, but she showed great fight and determination and recovered really well after, and started to get a life back. She got engaged, bought a place and got a job overseas. Then a couple of months ago she had to have another operation which was a blow and a stark reminder that even though it is manageable it won&#8217;t go away. Again she was so upbeat about it and the operation went well and she has recovered. Then I had it. My inspiration. If she can go through all of this and be so positive about it then I can run two marathons for her and for charity again. The work of Cancer Research UK and so many others means that people can stay alive longer and manage it.</p>
<p>This is not a normal thing to do so I sought the blessing of a trusted friend who I knew understood my madness. She said that it was of course crazy and that it would more than likely ruin my body, but it was for such a good cause that it was worth it. But also that my friend would appreciate what I was doing for her. I took that as permission to go ahead. I heard what I needed to. She knows me well.</p>
<p>After a few drinks on Friday my friend started talking about how this was the first day of her preparation course for going overseas, and that just being there led to a sense of emotion that after all she had been through, it was finally starting (a previous posting couldn&#8217;t happen because of the diagnosis and need for treatment) a new chapter of her life. And it is more than deserved. So she wanted to celebrate, and I was more than happy to do that with her. After getting a bit emotional, it got us talking about the future and mortality. It&#8217;s something that happens to all of us but for her it&#8217;s more apparent and real.  As I said learning about Paris and then other sad news on Saturday made this more poignant (Paris was my first ever marathon and set me on this path.) Who of those caught up in the Paris attacks would have thought that could happen to them when going to a gig to watch a band, or going for a drink, or going to a restaurant. These are the things we do to have fun and unwind. It&#8217;s what I did Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. But this kind of attack is the everyday reality for so many people in other so many other countries that it puts everything in perspective.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.”<br />
― <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13275.Charles_Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Who knows what might happen or how long we have. My friend can&#8217;t plan too far ahead, and with the advice of her oncologist no less, all you can do is enjoy each moment now. Live your life and que sera sera. Which is what she&#8217;s doing and why I am going enjoy every minute of this journey. At the end of the day I am choosing to do it and no one is forcing me. I love running and I am looking forward to this challenge.  It won&#8217;t be easy and I will be relying on my determination and of course my friends&#8217; support to help get me through. I&#8217;m not going to do what I normally do and lock myself away from folk. Of course I will work damn hard at it but I will enjoy myself every step of the way. I will also enjoy seeing the people I love, spend time with my Godchildren as much as I can and all that jazz.</p>
<p>But I know that whenever I inevitably struggle, or it seems like it is getting too much, I will take a step back, breathe and remember why I&#8217;m doing it. Pour elle. Pour Lisa.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While being shown the second part of new training plan in the gym this morning, I realised that my upper body is stronger than my lower half. This might seem strange coming from a runner but I was doing exercises that are designed to work on the parts of the body that running races doesn&#8217;t affect. Long distance running especially, is a pretty much linear exercise so there is little twisting, starting and stopping etc. The theory is that working on this will help me produce more power and drive me to go faster. What this new plan is showing me is where my weaknesses are (leg balance for example is quite poor right now.) It&#8217;s better I find them out now so I can work on them and then be ready for when I start my training properly in the New Year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being the Royal Courts of Justice, the gym is of course used by members of the judiciary. The ones I&#8217;ve met in there have been quite friendly, and one of them in particular saw me doing one of the exercises today. These were the &#8220;<a href="http://www.bosu.com/">Bosu ball</a>&#8221; press-ups. A bosu ball is essentially half a medicine ball with a plastic base, and you use it with ball side down (ahem) for balancing exercises. When I got back to the changing room he asked me, &#8220;I&#8217;m interested to know what the benefits of doing a press-up like that as opposed to a normal one?&#8221;. I replied repeating what Adam the trainer had told me, &#8220;apparently you use more of your core and upper back muscles as you have to try and balance yourself while doing it.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting, I have a daughter and we were both using the gym together once, and doing a circuit together. We were supposed to both do some sit-ups and so I did them the way I had always done them, with your hands behind your head. I started them and she stopped and burst out laughing. &#8216;What are you doing?! That&#8217;s not how you do a sit-up!&#8217; What do you mean? It&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always done them! She explained that it&#8217;s very inefficient and it doesn&#8217;t actually engage your stomach muscles effectively. I remember some old footage of Joe Louis the boxer training and that&#8217;s how he did them and he was arguably the greatest boxer of all time (<em>see Coming to America for this debate</em>). If it was good enough for him! But it&#8217;s interesting how these techniques are changing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was fascinated by this, but became conscious that I was there listening to him in just my underwear. This could be a nightmare. Me, in my underwear, in front of a judge. Oh well. Gym rules.</p>
<p>I listened intently to another story by him (that 9.30 meeting was still achievable) &#8220;I read Fred Trueman&#8217;s biography recently and he used to be a miner before becoming a cricketer. For one tour, these were the days that you traveled by boat, the journey would take three weeks. So they decided to take an Olympic runner with them to work on their fitness while they traveled. This was all new at the time. Just before the first session, the whole squad were present on the deck except for Fred. So the trainer went to find him and found him on a lounger with a beer in his hand and sunglasses on. The trainer said, &#8216;Erm Fred, aren&#8217;t you coming to the fitness session&#8217; to which he replied &#8216;Look, I&#8217;ve bowled all summer for my county and country and taken lots of wickets. I will be bowling lots more when we get there. I need to rest so fuck off!&#8217;. This is arguably our greatest fast bowler and he took over 300 wickets playing over 20 years. He was never broke down or got injured. Trueman always maintained that he was &#8216;blessed by two things from birth&#8217;: the &#8216;Trueman tenacity&#8217; and the &#8216;perfect physique for a fast bowler&#8217;. It probably also helped that he was miner. But with all the modern training plans and techniques can you imagine getting away with that these days? It just wouldn&#8217;t happen would it?</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I think I might try some press-ups using that ball then you can all have a good laugh at me too!&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t dare.</p>
<p>I think it shows how different things work for different people. Who knows if this gym plan will be effective. This is the exciting part trying new things and experimenting to see what works for me. Running has been a journey of discovery, finding out what I&#8217;m capable of both mentally and physically, surprising myself each time. Long may it continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did make that 9.30 meeting. Fully clothed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m an avid fan of BBC Radio 6 Music and I&#8217;m always trying to get take part or get something featured on one of their shows and as yet have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I have failed to “win” Tea Time Theme Time on the Radcliffe and Maconie show (though I should have won it once when I guessed the link straight away but missed out because I sent it to the wrong number like the utter numbskull that I am.) I&#8217;ve had a couple of mentions, coming a close second once but still that prize of winner alludes me.  On top of that I&#8217;ve tried in vain to have a song featured on The Chain, &#8220;officially the longest listener-generated thematically linked sequence of musically based items on the radio&#8221;. I even left a drunken message on their overnight answer phone thinking they might find it endearing only to be snubbed yet again. The closest I got was a song I submitted being chosen but someone else beating me to it and being the one they spoke to. Git.</p>
<p>I never give up so will continue trying but I’ve decided to switch my efforts in the short term to the early morning. Being an early riser the Chris Hawkins show which starts at 5am is what I wake up to. At the moment he has something called ‘5 before 6’ where someone suggests five songs to be played throughout the week saying why they’re significant to them.</p>
<p>How could I beat the system and stand a chance of getting my songs chosen? The songs have to be good and something I&#8217;d want to hear at 0555 of a morning of course, but I need a hook to grab their attention. Then it hit me. Why not have a running based theme and use the whole two marathons in six days thing as the selling point? Why not milk it. I am here.</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel so extraordinary<br />
Something&#8217;s got a hold on me<br />
I get this feeling I&#8217;m in motion<br />
A sudden sense of liberty</p></blockquote>
<p>So I started thinking what my favourite tracks to run to were. What were the criteria to determine this? Good beat? Fast music? Inspirational lyrics? Something that when it comes on provides you with a much needed injection of adrenaline and erect nipples? Just a great song period? I&#8217;m not ashamed to say my running playlist contains pop songs by the likes of the Sugababes, S Club 7, and Take That. I mean it&#8217;s all about a freak like me reaching for them there stars to rule the world (of running.) I would never of course listen to these songs outside of a running scenario&#8230;so don&#8217;t come that.</p>
<p>Oh but to just choose five for this exercise. It&#8217;s not easy. But this is my current thinking:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong><br />
<em><strong>Sonny J &#8211; Can&#8217;t Stop Moving</strong></em><br />
A really positive song, a good beat to run to, and you really can&#8217;t stop moving those legs&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
<em><strong>AC/DC &#8211; Highway to Hell</strong></em><br />
Sometimes it can feel like you&#8217;re on the highway to hell running countless miles but this dirty, guitar fuelled rock beast makes everything better.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br />
<strong><em>New Order &#8211; True Faith</em></strong><br />
Not only a great song with the ideal beat but the line, &#8220;I get this feeling I&#8217;m in motion, a sudden sense of liberty&#8221; really sums up what running feels like to me.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong><br />
<em><strong>Sugar &#8211; If I Can&#8217;t Change Your Mind</strong></em><br />
Just really positive music from the off and boosts the adrenaline something chronic to speed up those legs. Plus a song about a break-up never sounded so uplifting.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong><br />
<em><strong>Bruce Springsteen &#8211; Born to Run </strong></em><br />
I don&#8217;t think this needs an explanation in the context. Literally fucking Boss.</p>
<p>It might change before I submit but I&#8217;d love to hear what you think. My running playlist does need updating and refreshing so grateful for any suggestions to keep me suitably inspired and motivated. As evidenced above, if it meets the criteria, then I ain&#8217;t fussy (except for Robbie Williams. Anyone who suggests him will be unfriended, blocked, and quartered). Help me out via the comments below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So here it is. The return of my blog with a streamlined new name, on a new platform and a new, clean, refreshed look. I figured I probably bore too many people with my running antics (and various other rubbish) on Facebook so why not switch it to a dedicated blog where I can say much more and only those who wish to be bored can attempt to read it…</p>
<p>Welcome to those who have kept on going (it’s a long one to get started to set the context so you may need some sort of stimulant.) So why am I restarting my blog? Some of you may know I have taken on the challenge of running both the Boston Marathon and London Marathon in the space of six days. Yes that’s right. Two marathons in six days. You are probably thinking I am mad and this is a crazy idea and it quite clearly is, but anyone who knows me is fully aware that I am not normal anyway. This will chart my journey: <em><span class="st"> the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles.</span></em></p>
<p>I’m under no illusion, it’s going to be hard work and extremely tough at times but what I’ve realised over the last few weeks is that I have some of the best and most supportive friends one could hope for. They’ve already done so much to help me come to terms with what I’m trying to achieve and to remind me to look after myself which apparently I neglect to do at times. I have my reasons for doing this (which will be explained in a later post) and this is what will drive me. They know this and I will be relying on their support and their patience with my inevitable breakdowns and swinging moods to get me through.</p>
<p><strong>How to train <del>your dragon</del></strong> <strong>for two marathons</strong></p>
<p>To prepare for this I need to prepare and strengthen my body for the extra training and miles I will need to put in. I asked Adam in my work gym to come up with a programme for this very reason and he became very excited at the prospect of devising a &#8216;two marathon plan&#8217;. So much so that when speaking to someone in one of the private offices the day after they asked me if I was the one “running two marathons?” “How do you know that?!” I asked incredulously. Adam had told her what I was doing and what he was planning. I was providing quite the challenge to him apparently (something my manager has also said about me). She of course said I was mad and went on to tell me all the things that I should be worried about like short recovery time, flight back, jet-lag etc.  So news had reached private office and I was being reminded of all the negative aspects of doing this. Thanks for that. No pressure then.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Silent darkness creeps into your soul<br />
And removes the light of self-control<br />
The cave that holds you captive has no doors<br />
Burnin&#8217; with determination<br />
To even up the score”</p></blockquote>
<p>My pre-training training sort of started yesterday when I went for my first run back after completing the Amsterdam Marathon two weeks previously. It was only a couple of miles but legs felt a bit stiff and tight. It was a reminder of the challenge of running a marathon six days after the first one with the added bonus of flying back and jet-lag. Good thing I was reminded about that.</p>
<p>I trialed the first part of my new gym programme today which focused on the lower body. I won’t bore you (&#8220;too late for that!&#8221; I hear some of you cry) with the details but suffice to say there were plenty of lunges and squats which was a timely reminder to wear secure, self-containing underwear&#8230; Part two “the upper body” trials on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s H&amp;S gone mad&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://whisperisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rocky-iv-cart.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-20 size-medium" src="https://whisperisms.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rocky-iv-cart.jpg?w=300&#038;h=209" alt="rocky iv cart" width="300" height="209" /></a>In terms of my own ideas for the training plan, apparently it’s NOT feasible to recreate the winter training montage from Rocky IV in the gym due to the lack of mountainous conditions and farming equipment in the ‘crypt’ of the Royal Courts. Plus a whole bunch of other reasons. The steroid fueled Commie version is not appropriate either. Blah blah. My offer to bring in fake snow to throw over the equipment was frowned upon due it potentially being a “fire hazard” and “generally unsafe.” Honestly, what do I pay £25 a month for? I mean if you’re not at least prepared to meet me halfway on this. The bloomin’ Health &amp; Safety police are just as bad as those “femi-nazis”. Where did we go wrong? Did we lose a war I didn’t know about? AND to add insult to injury they have the nerve to charge me £3 extra for this non-Rocky based plan. This country. Anyway that battle will rage on but as the H&amp;S fascists cannot police the power of my imagination, this is what will be playing in my mind anytime I darn well please for pure inspiration…plus I might attempt growing the beard.</p>
