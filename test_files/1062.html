		<div class="post-content">
			<p>&#8230;So, where did I leave off here?</p>
<p>I bought a tiny Meyer lemon tree at Ott&#8217;s Nursery in Schwenksville (home of the Mountain of Mums) about five years ago, just after we moved to Philadelphia. Our first apartment in the city received almost zero sunlight, and after a month or two of watching it start to become a citrus version of Charlie Brown&#8217;s pathetic Christmas tree, I brought it to work, where it sat in a much sunnier spot on my desk and got a better grip on life. It had four blossoms on it when I bought it, but I pinched them off right away, since the tree only had a few leaves and I wanted it to put its energy into getting a little bigger.</p>
<p>Our next apartment got much more sunlight, so I took the tree back home, where it put out many new leaves, then shed all but one of them when the apartment got too cold in the winter. It turns out that if a Meyer lemon gets enough warmth on its leaves while the roots stay cold, the plant will drop leaves to avoid scorching them &#8211; the roots aren&#8217;t able to pump cool water up to the leaves fast enough to cool them off from the sun they&#8217;re receiving. I spent a lot of time swaddling the pot and watering it with warm water and moving it from window to window. I was afraid I&#8217;d killed it, but in the spring it put out leaves almost nonchalantly, as though nothing at all had happened. I imagine it would have snickered to itself, if it could.</p>
<p>Our third and current apartment has a nifty spot in the kitchen where my Meyer lemon gets plenty of sunlight, especially in the morning, and the pot can sit near the heating vent and stay warm through the winter. It takes up a little more of my valuable counter space than I would like, and it does, on rare occasions, garnish plates of food with unwanted lemon leaves. But it seems to be happy, and puts out leaves on a fairly regular basis. I give it fertilizer on a schedule and water it the way that lemons like to be watered, and in return it cleans carbon dioxide out of the air and tries to play Chef Ramsey with my plates of spaghetti.</p>
<p>For the past two years, I&#8217;ve also moved the tree outside during the summer. Our neighborhood is pretty quiet, and I was not too worried about someone walking off with it. The first year, everything was great. We had a hot, humid summer with lots of sunny days and weekly thunderstorms &#8211; just the kind of weather that the tree likes. It took the opportunity to grow some extra branches. The second year, to my chagrin, one of the neighbor children was attracted to the pot, grabbed the stem, and yanked the tree up by the roots. I discovered it a few hours later when I went out to do laundry. There was much fretting and repotting and fertilizing and gentle pats on the root ball. One year later, the tree is fine, but I am definitely not planning to put it outside our apartment this summer.</p>
<p>So basically I slave over this tree and every so often I wonder, goshdarnit, when is it going to start earning its keep around here and producing some fruit? By all accounts, Meyer lemons are wonderful for cooking, a little sweeter than regular lemons. And I do love a good lemon. Just the other day, while I was thinking about how best to get the tree outside for the summer without risking another uprooting, I went into the kitchen to examine the pot&#8230;and found that the tree had finally produced a blossom:</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lemonblossom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232" title="lemonblossom" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lemonblossom.jpg?w=490" alt="Meyer lemon blossom"   /></a></p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s more like it! This single flower was incredibly fragrant. It lasted for roughly a week before the petals finally dropped. One of them accidentally ended up on the plate with Doug&#8217;s turkey burger&#8230;oops. About two days after the bud opened, I took a paintbrush and gently brushed the pollen from the anthers down onto the pistil, just in case none of it made it onto the pistil by itself. Fingers crossed for the tree&#8217;s first lemon sometime this summer! I know it&#8217;s silly, but I like to imagine that the tree is so grateful to me for all the watering and fertilizing that it decided to give me a little botanical Mother&#8217;s Day present.</p>

<em>&#8220;Happy Mother&#8217;s Day, Human Mom!&#8221;</em></p>

			<p>Look what we uncovered in the box of Christmas tree ornaments last Sunday:</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/ornament_yoshimi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" title="ornament_yoshimi" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/ornament_yoshimi.jpg?w=490" alt="O Christmas cat, o Christmas cat, how fuzzy are your branches!"   /></a></p>
<p>This is Yoshimi, my Assigned Cat.  (Doug&#8217;s Assigned Cat is Bella, our middle-aged pudgy calico.)  As you can see, she&#8217;s fond of boxes, especially boxes that have not yet been fully emptied.  I&#8217;m tempted to make her the tree topper this year, instead of the not-very-interesting wooden star that came from Target six year ago.  When I suggested this idea to Doug, who was still recovering from putting many, many strings of lights on the tree, the discussion devolved into making a list of other improbable things to put on top of the tree, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plush <a href="http://www.domonation.com/" target="_blank">Domo</a> that we found in a clearance bin at Toys&#8217;R&#8217;Us</li>
<li>an Easter Island head</li>
<li>a smaller Christmas tree, which would itself be topped with an even tinier Christmas tree</li>
<li>a tarantula hand puppet</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we&#8217;ll stick with the wooden star&#8230;for now.</p>

			<p>Doug and I like to take vacations in the fall. I can find more Thursdays and Fridays in the fall when I can take time off without leaving our very small department understaffed, and Doug likes to roam the earth when it&#8217;s not broiling hot. This year we spent a few days in New York&#8217;s Hudson Highlands, a few miles north of West Point, during the third week of October when the leaves were at their peak. Our prime directive was to spend an entire weekday at <a href="http://www.stormking.org/index.html" target="_blank">Storm King Art Center</a>, a 500-acre sculpture park in Mountainville, New York.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to capture the experience of Storm King in words. The property is sort of a long rectangle, quite hilly, with a double loop of paved walkway and many unpaved paths and trails. The grounds have been beautifully landscaped with trees (some in very formal geometric plantings—there are two allées, one oak and one maple—and others more naturally occurring) and wild grasses. Then, scattered over the property, are hundreds of sculptures. Many of the original acquisitions are clustered around the central museum building in the middle of the grounds, while more monolithic recent purchases are further afield, where they can be admired from neighboring hilltops. A tram will take you around the main loops while a recording points out some of the major works, but to really see everything, you need to be willing to walk. A lot.</p>
<p>It was freezing cold on the day we were there, and the weather changed several times in the course of a few hours—from sunny to cloudy to a brief drizzle, followed by bright sunlight, followed by overcast skies and a brisk wind. We took layers off, we put layers back on, we exchanged layers with each other to compare their merits. (Doug would like to sneak off with my fuzzy gloves.) We also took many, many photos, a sample of which are below.</p>
<p>One of the first pieces we came across after parking in the north lot was an Alexander Calder stabile, <em>The Arch</em> (1975):</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201" title="stormking02" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking02.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Nearby is Tal Streeter&#8217;s <em>Endless Column</em> (1968), intended to evoke the sense of a connection between the earth and sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-202 aligncenter" title="stormking03" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking03.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Another large piece in the Meadows section of the art center is Alexander Liberman&#8217;s <em>Iliad</em> (1974-76), one of three sculptures by Liberman that we saw.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203" title="stormking04" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking04.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a long view of the South Fields, with three sculptures by Mark di Suvero displayed quite dramatically.  In the foreground is <em>Mon Père, Mon Père</em> (1973-75), in the middle is <em>Beethoven&#8217;s Quartet</em> (2003), and in the distance you can just make out <em>Pyramidian</em> (1987-88) near the end of the maple allée.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204" title="stormking05" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking05.jpg?w=490&#038;h=314" alt="" width="490" height="314" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As we headed past these towering chunks of steel beam, we caught our first glimpse of Andy Goldsworthy&#8217;s<em> Storm King Wall</em> (1997-98), one of the highlights of our visit.  The wall seems to dip down into this pond and snake back out on the far bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205" title="stormking06" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking06.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Storm King grounds are right next to the New York Thruway.  <em>Storm King Wall</em> stretches up the hill, through the treeline on the border of the property, nearly touching the busy highway.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" title="stormking07" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking07.jpg?w=490&#038;h=336" alt="" width="490" height="336" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After diving down the hill, into the pond, and up the slope of the farther side, the wall becomes a sinuous fortress wall for these golden trees:</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" title="stormking08" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking08.jpg?w=490&#038;h=334" alt="" width="490" height="334" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to get a photo that does the wall complete justice.  Doug got close, though:</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" title="stormking09" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking09.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>By the time we reached the bottom of the South Fields and began to loop around to the north again, we had covered about four miles of pathway and the sun was starting to disappear again.  We climbed up an unpaved hillside path and had a Terry Gilliam moment:</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" title="stormking10" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking10.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking10.jpg"></a>This is <em>Three-Legged Buddha</em> (2007) by Zhang Huan.  Looks like it belongs in Dr. Parnassus&#8217; Imaginarium, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>After a while, we got tired of walking and decided to ride the tram around the art center for a bit. As we waited for the tram to arrive at the base of Museum Hill, we admired Johnny Swing&#8217;s <em>Nickel Couch</em> (2001).</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" title="stormking11" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking11.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="stormking12" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking12.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It took us about six hours to see most of the park&#8217;s sculptures. We missed a few that were on the more challenging trails, and breezed past a few more that didn&#8217;t strike our interest for whatever reason. And of course we spent some time just admiring the foliage, which was at its peak.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212" title="stormking13" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking13.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Afterward, we set out in search of food.  The only problem with vacationing in tiny towns is that it&#8217;s tricky to find places to eat.  About half of the cafes in the town where we stayed were open for breakfast and lunch only, which limited us to the local pizza parlor, a little restaurant at the train station, and a trattoria for which I hadn&#8217;t brought acceptably fancy clothing.  On our first night we ate at the depot, but we wanted to be a bit adventurous the second night, so we drove to the equally tiny and picturesque town near Storm King.  We ended up at a pizzeria with real New York-style pizza, and I can admit without a trace of shame that no pizzeria in Philadelphia can hold a candle to genuine pizza from New York.</p>
<p>We arrived back at our inn in Cold Spring just before sunset, in time to light a little fire in the woodburning stove and relax with some reading.  The next morning, we snapped a quick picture before it was time to pack up the car and go.</p>
<p><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200" title="stormking01" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/stormking01.jpg?w=490" alt=""   border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We drove home on back roads, through the outrageously beautiful woods of New York and into farm country in New Jersey.  Along the way, we stopped at Mackey&#8217;s Orchard in Belvidere to relive a little bit of my childhood&#8230;and to buy pumpkin soft-serve ice cream, apples for baking, and pumpkins to carve for Halloween.</p>
<p>I already want to go back!</p>

			<p>O hai&#8230;</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been sick pretty much all week with what I can only describe as a diabolical cross between the common cold and bubonic plague.  On Tuesday, when it started, I thought it was just a cold, and then it invited over post-nasal drip, a sore throat, and a fever for an extended house party.  Haven&#8217;t really slept more than 30 minutes at a time for three consecutive nights, except for the wee hours of Thursday morning when I managed to stay asleep for an entire hour between 4:45 and 5:45 a.m.  My brain was absolutely 100% in favor of the whole &#8220;sleep&#8221; thing, but my body was not.  Sadly, I&#8217;ve spent much of my life trying to convince my body that it and my brain are actually on the same side.  I can imagine a sort of sub-verbal dialogue going on in the night:</p>
<p><strong>Brain:</strong> Hey, how about some sleep?  I hear it&#8217;s all the rage this time of night.<br />
<strong>Body:</strong> Oh, no you don&#8217;t, you tricky, tricky brain!  I know what you&#8217;re up to!  You&#8217;re gonna put me to sleep, then pilot me out the door and straight down to South Street for a round of tattoos and piercings.  I&#8217;ll probably wake up with &#8220;My body is a jerk&#8221; tattooed in 36-point Papyrus font on my forehead.<br />
<strong>Brain:</strong> What?<br />
<strong>Body:</strong> (In a surly undertone) I&#8217;m not gonna, you can&#8217;t make me.</p>
<p>By Friday I was completely exhausted, also feverish, so I didn&#8217;t go to work and went to the doctor instead to be tortured with tongue depressors and sent home with a bottle of steroids to spray up my nose.  (Isn&#8217;t the world strange?)  Doug, who is currently employed as house husband and all-purpose manservant, has been very kind about bringing me milkshakes and tea, adjusting the ambient indoor temperature to meet my whims, and generally being unsurprised when his zombie wife periodically lurches out of the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Where are you going now?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Uh, I felt a sudden urge to blog.<br />
<strong>Doug:</strong> Mmm-<em>hmmm</em>.</p>
<p>On a completely separate and more somber note, we found out on Wednesday night that the 3-month-old daughter of friends had died.  She had been born with a severe heart defect, one that is treatable through a series of surgeries, but very challenging to cope with.  She had undergone her first surgery just a few weeks after birth, then spent several more weeks recuperating in the hospital, having trouble with a feeding tube, and had finally been sent home just a few weeks ago.  Despite the absolutely perfect care she was receiving from her parents and visiting nurses, she developed an infection and had to be rushed back to the hospital, but she was past the point of saving.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just heartbroken for our friends, who had their daughter with them for such a brief time before losing her&#8230;no parent should ever have to go through the pain of losing a baby.  Her father kept a friends-only blog with photos and information on her treatment, so although we hadn&#8217;t gotten to meet the baby in person, we did get to see many beautiful pictures.  Our friends are Jewish, so we are preparing to pay our first shiva call, if I am well enough to not make everyone sick by then.  I think we&#8217;re both nervous, not wanting to do or say anything wrong.  However, it&#8217;s important for us to be there if we can.  </p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a lot of unhappiness for one week.  But sinus infections go away eventually, even if they come disguised as bubonic plague, and mourners are comforted.  Our friends are good people and good parents, with a wonderful 2-year-old son, who have lots of family and friends close by to help them.  The more I read about sitting shiva, the more impressed I am by this way of mourning&#8230;it recognizes a real need to stop <em>everything</em> that one is doing, all the stuff that isn&#8217;t really important, to focus on mourning for the person who is gone, and to let the community act as comforters.  I feel the <em>need</em> to act as a comforter&#8230;it is the right thing to do at this time.  (I also like the double meaning of the word &#8220;comforter&#8221;, because I&#8217;d like to be a big blanket around their shoulders.  Probably that&#8217;s the fever talking.)</p>

<p>Philadelphia is in the middle of its sixth heat wave this summer, and since it&#8217;s 300 skillion degrees outside today, Doug and I are spending the day inside, wrapped around the air conditioners.  Doug received his layoff notice on Tuesday, and will be home on severance pay for the month of August, so we are also recovering from a rough week.</p>
<p>The photo above was taken two years ago in September, at the boardwalk in Seaside Heights, shortly before <em>The Jersey Shore</em> gave everyone a refresher course in ridiculous shore stereotypes.  Doug and I took a day trip to Island Beach State Park last month, just before the June heat waves really got started&#8230;we spent the morning on the beach getting sunburned by accident, then walked up and down the boardwalk all afternoon, eating Three Brothers pizza and Kohr Bros. custard, playing Skee Ball and air hockey, and trying (unsuccessfully) to win stuffed animals from the claw machines.  (Guys, let me let you in on a little secret here.  Each time the claw machines are restocked, the arcade owners first take all of the stuffed animals and soak them thoroughly in a pheremone mixture that is only detectable by women.  This is why we beg you to win us things that we would never consider purchasing outright, like owls made of fuschia plush that hoot when you squeeze them.  Also, those machines are also totally rigged so that there&#8217;s no tension in the claw, but I bet you already knew that.)</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m about ready for another day like that.</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;">So, uh&#8230;I took a bit of a hiatus from blogging for a bit there, partly because I was busy in meatspace and partly because while I like to blog about things that are awesome, I had a number of things going on that were not so awesome.  However, Doug and I have done enough cool stuff now that I have a backlog of things to blog about and will have to be clever about remembering them all in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>Striking while the memory is fresh, then, I&#8217;ll share that Doug and I had a nice evening out on the town last night.  He met me at work and we walked down into Center City, to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Philadelphia-PA/500-Degrees/354282913459" target="_blank">500°</a> at 15th and Sansom for cheeseburgers and truffle fries (mmm&#8230;mushroomy). For some weird reason, most city restaurants intimidate me, even after living and working here for 4 years. There&#8217;s always so much activity on the street, and I&#8217;ve spent so much time trying to navigate the sidewalk without looking like a tourist or getting run over by a bicycle, that at the moment when I walk inside the restaurant, I&#8217;m all nervous about being in the way of all the real city dwellers who know exactly how to order and where to sit. Luckily for me, there was not a huge crowd at 500°, the counter guy was super nice, and even though they were playing the Beatles over the PA system, I could hear him when he asked me what kind of fries I wanted.</p>
<p>Afterward, we walked a little farther down Sansom for dessert at <a href="http://capogirogelato.com/" target="_blank">Capogiro</a>, where I have been wanting to go for a long time, for gelato made on the premises. I got the &#8220;burnt sugar&#8221; gelato&#8230;dark caramel that really did taste like the topping on creme brulée as the description on their website promised. Doug got the &#8220;cioccolato scuro&#8221;, best described as very cold fudge in a cup. We&#8217;ll be doing this again, I promise.</p>
<p>The main event of the evening was a show at Johnny Brenda&#8217;s&#8230;specifically, the <a href="http://www.elrarecords.com/tour.html" target="_blank">Sun Ra Arkestra</a> celebrating their bandleader Marshall Allen&#8217;s 86th birthday.  Doug has seen the Arkestra once or twice before at Tritone in Old City, but I had never seen them perform—it is certainly a sight to see.</p>
<p>A little background: Sun Ra was the jazz composer and pianist who founded the Sun Ra Arkestra in the 1950s and was its bandleader until his death in 1993.  He also believed himself to be a being from Saturn who urged his fellow black Americans to leave the Earth behind and seek out a peaceful civilization in outer space.  This interesting combination of musical talent and cosmic philosophy resulted in a number of really cool-sounding outer-space-themed albums.  The Arkestra carries on this tradition by playing his space-themed compositions, blending synthesizer sounds reminiscent of flying saucers and laser guns with the traditional jazz instruments, and wearing dramatic sequined serapes and hats.  (Sun Ra had an amazing collection of headwear inspired by ancient Egyptian pharaohs&#8217; headdresses.)  Marshall Allen, all decked out in a red sequined robe and matching red pointed hat, with a white beard and a saxophone around his neck, looked like he&#8217;d fit right in at Hogwarts as the wizard jazz band instructor.</p>
<p>They sounded amazing.  It&#8217;s lively jazz, definitely something that you stand and dance along with, which a number of the folks in front of me were doing.  The Arkestra seemed like it could have played forever, but we had to leave before the second set&#8230;work day the next day, dontcha know.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little footage from YouTube of a similar performance a year or so ago&#8230;</p>

<p>Dude, the weather has been just perfect all weekend.  Not only were these crocuses (crocii?) inspired to bloom now that the snow is all gone from the southern side of the lawn, but a honeybee workforce was no doubt being paid double time to gather pollen on a Sunday afternoon.  Somehow I suspect that this guarantees we&#8217;ll get one more crippling snowstorm before the winter is officially over.</p>

			<p>As you may have heard, we <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/weather/02/06/winter.storm/index.html" target="_blank">got a little snow</a> a few weeks ago&#8230;it snowed all day Saturday, then snowed again on Wednesday, which shut down the city for two days and resulted in my first- and second-ever adult snow days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/snow1.jpg?w=490" alt="Snow falling on Wednesday afternoon" align="center" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Thursday was beautiful but cold.  Doug shoveled out our car and helped some neighbors while a cleanup crew shoved fallen trees and branches into woodchippers all over the complex.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Mostly we stayed inside watching movies and being grateful that our power didn&#8217;t go out.  Now, nearly two weeks later, it&#8217;s raining and above freezing, so all those feet of snow are washing away&#8230;but supposedly there&#8217;s another major storm on the way this week.  I think I&#8217;m just going to hibernate until March.</p>

			<p>Last weekend, I cleaned out my closet and found that I own only two skirts, neither of which I wear much.  I last purchased non-Halloween makeup for my own wedding in 2004.  My ears have been pierced since I was ten years old, but I rarely wear earrings, so on New Year&#8217;s Eve I had a real struggle trying to get a plain stud into the left hole.  The girly-girl section of my brain, never terribly large to begin with, has been left alone to atrophy for far too long, so I recently developed an interest in perfume.  Not surprisingly, I haven&#8217;t bought any of that for a long time either&#8230;I have a tiny bottle of cologne called Beyond (from Eddie Bauer, of all places, and they stopped making it years ago) and a couple of bottles of Crabtree &amp; Evelyn scents, but nothing that I wear frequently.</p>
<p>To this end, I&#8217;ve started lurking near perfume samples, looking for something I can try out without having salespeople hanging all over me.  Doug and I were doing some last-minute Christmas shopping in Chestnut Hill, in a store that sells a wide variety of things that are only interesting to women.  While Doug tried to prevent his brain from crawling out his ear to escape, I found some perfumes from a company called <a href="http://www.tokyo-milk.com/parfum/eau-de-parfums.html" target="_blank">Toyko Milk</a> with interesting-looking bottles.  I didn&#8217;t try any in the store, but looked them up online later, and eventually ordered a sample set from <a href="http://beautyhabit.com/" target="_blank">Beautyhabit Apothecary</a>.  They were waiting for me when I got home on Friday night.  Yay!</p>
<p>First thing Saturday, I decided to try out the first sample: Poe&#8217;s Tobacco, described as &#8220;tobac, tea leaves, amberwood and autumn apple&#8221;.  When I uncapped the teeny tiny vial, it didn&#8217;t smell anything like tobacco&#8230;more like fresh leaves with a little citrus.  Doug liked it, but couldn&#8217;t smell any tobacco either.  We spent the day working around the apartment and being surprised by the snow that unexpectedly started to fall in the early afternoon.  We got our thermal curtains hung at long last and ordered Indian takeout&mdash;chicken makhani and samosas from <a href="http://www.tiffin.com" target="_blank">Tiffin</a> in Mount Airy&mdash;to celebrate the fact that less than 100 percent of our heat is now flying directly out of the windows.  By evening, my Poe&#8217;s Tobacco smelled a tiny bit like sweet pipe smoke and apples.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I opened the second sample, called Honey &amp; the Moon.  This one is supposed to smell like &#8220;honey, sugared violet, jasmine and sandalwood&#8221;.  It smelled sweet when I opened the vial, but as soon as I put it on, it smelled very strongly like a sweet tobacco!  I wasn&#8217;t really crazy about it; Doug is sure that the vials must have been mislabeled.  The vials themselves are unlabeled&mdash;the labels are on the miniscule ziplock bags they came packaged in&mdash;so that&#8217;s a distinct possibility.  If the store in Chestnut Hill is still selling this brand, I might stop in and try their tester scent&#8230;I know I saw Honey &amp; the Moon on their shelf, and I wonder if my samples did get mixed up.  </p>
<p>For tomorrow I&#8217;ve got one last perfume to try&mdash;this one&#8217;s called Ex Libris, a blend of &#8220;fig leaf, magnolia, bronzed musk and cardamom&#8221;.  So far I&#8217;m not insanely wild about the first two scents, so I&#8217;m hoping this one is awesome.  </p>

			<p>Wow, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted anything!  My time has been taken up with a work project—teaching myself the basics of UNIX administration—and making thermal curtains during the evenings.  At long last, the curtains are ready to hang and I&#8217;ve successfully patched and installed Sun Java Web Server 7 on our test box, so I can come back to my little blog here.</p>
<p>After a long interval of sewing nothing but big flat things (ahem, thermal curtains), I had a few minutes to spare on Saturday morning, so I put together a little felt needle book to store all of my needles, after I gathered them up from where they were jabbed into spools of thread or buried in my pincushion.  Over Christmas I received a beautiful set of Gingher sewing scissors, as well as a book on making hand-stitched things with felt, so this was a nice way to inaugurate both gifts.  I didn&#8217;t have any wool felt (it&#8217;s harder to find than you&#8217;d think) so I substituted plain craft felt—it&#8217;s not as plush as wool felt would have been, but I like the finished result anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/needlebook.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-162 aligncenter" title="needlebook" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/needlebook.jpg?w=490" alt="Needlebook cover"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Here&#8217;s the closed book.  The stitches are intended to look a little rustic&#8230;lucky for me!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/needlebook2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-163" title="needlebook2" src="https://gingerlemonindigo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/needlebook2.jpg?w=490" alt="Needlebook interior"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And here&#8217;s a view of the inside of the book.  It has four felt &#8220;pages&#8221; that will let me store all kinds of needles, or even pins in a pinch.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The whole thing was sort of a riff on <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/good-things/felt-sewing-book" target="_blank">Martha Stewart&#8217;s felt sewing book</a>.  Hers is meant for more than just needles; this one is probably a bit smaller.</p>
